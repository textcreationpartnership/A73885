         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150587:7"/> the authour, and the neceſsity of the duties herein handled, gave me not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a toleration, but a command, to print it, it treates of the purchaſe, of the moſt precious commodity, the truth. Of the Digeſtion of the moſt ſalubrious foode, the word. Of the ſuite for the moſt ſoveraigne balme, pardon of ſin. And laſtly, of not quenching the ſpirit; and if it be the duty of every man, to cheriſh this holy flame in his owne ſoule, for mee, not to kindle it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as farre as in me lay, I held it piacular: Jt is true indeede, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy tells us, that elementary fire, needs no fewell, but that culinary doth, experience informeth us: The ſpirit of God, conſider it in it ſelfe, is ſo far from needing any helpes to cheriſh the heate thereof, that it is the originall of all, both health and life in the ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:150587:7"/> but conſider, it as it worketh in the frigid ſoule of corrupted man: So though the ſpirit of God neede no auxiliary excitations, yet our dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse, and coldneſſe doth: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations with a kinde of command enforced mee to bring this worke to the preſſe, beeing nothing elſe but the fiery language, of thoſe Cloven Tongues, which did reſt on the head of that apoſtolicall divine, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hereof, which I hope being peruſed, will cauſe your Ladiſhip to ſay, it had beene pitty at the leaſt, if not impiety, to have depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the altars of ſo many Chriſtian hearts, of this ſacred fewell.</p>
            <p>Many other inducements J had to publiſh theſe Treatiſes, and among many this not the leaſt, to teſtifie my readineſſe, to acknowledge your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the 16. Verſ. the Apoſtle had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians to rejoyce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</hi> That is, that they ſhould carry themſelves ſo holily, &amp; circumſpectly, they ſhould walke ſo cloſely with God, that they might have continuall joy in the Holy Ghoſt from the ſence of Gods love,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150587:11"/> and favour. For it is a ſure thing that a Chriſtian ſo demeaning himſelfe as his rule guides him, may live the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life of any man in the world. <hi>He may keepe a continuall feaſt,</hi> and a <hi>feaſt</hi> is made <hi>for laughter, Eccl.</hi> 10. Dayes of feaſting are dayes of joy; and ſo a Chriſtian may make all his dayes feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, and joyfull like the dayes of the Jewes <hi>Purim, Eſter</hi> 9. <hi>dayes of feaſting and of joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be not ſo with a Chriſtian, it is moſt what his owne fault, and comes from ſome fayling and miſcarriage in himſelfe, that hee doth not that which he ſhould, to maintaine his heart in this happie frame. The Apoſtle therefore having adviſed hereto he layes downe ſome rules and meanes in certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, for the procuring and preſerving of this <hi>ſpirituall joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt <hi>Precept,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> He that would <hi>rejoyce continually,</hi> muſt <hi>pray continually,</hi> he that would <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore,</hi> muſt <hi>pray evermore.</hi> As is our conſcience of, and conſtancy in the duty of prayer: ſuch is the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150587:11"/> of our joy. Prayer neglected, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted brings an Eclips, &amp; an Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Interruption of our joy. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome praying, and conſtant rejoycing will never ſtand together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>Precept</hi> is this, verſ. 18. <hi>In al things give thankes,</hi> He that would <hi>rejoyce</hi> in all eſtates and conditions muſt be <hi>thankefull</hi> in all eſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He that would <hi>rejoyce</hi>

                     </gap>. The more thankefull wee are to God, the more cauſe of joy we ſhall have in God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third <hi>Precept,</hi> is this verſe 19. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> He that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore muſt keepe the ſpirit unquench'd. The way to keep ones ſelf warme, is to keepe the fire burning. It is a fond thing for a man to quench his fire, and then thinke to keepe himſelfe ſtill warme. It is no wonder that this man complaines of cold, that hath let his fire goe out, or hath himſelfe quench'd, and extinguiſht it. And thus we have the coherence of theſe words with the former.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150587:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Now for the words, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> In them there is a Metaphor, and a Metonymie. The metaphor in the word <hi>Quench:</hi> Quenching properly is of fire, when the light and heate of fire is abated and put out, wee uſe to ſay it is quenched. And hence is this word borrowed to ſignifie the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, decaying, or extinguiſhing of the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Metonymie is in the word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Spirit</hi> is taken</p>
                  <p n="1">I. For the eſſence of the Deity. So <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> It is not ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For the third perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Holy Ghoſt. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>The Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit.</hi> This is not meant here.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. For the gifts of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And thus it is here meant. Quench not the gifts and graces of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in this ſenſe is taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt for the gift of Propheſie.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.6.10. <hi>Then the Spirit of the Lord ſhall</hi> come <hi>upon</hi> thee; <hi>And the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150587:12"/> ſpirit of the Lord came upon him, viz.</hi> upon <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For <hi>Gifts and Abilities,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any calling, whether it bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary or heroicall, and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Spirit</hi> of fortitude and courage, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.6. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord came upon Sampſon, Judg.</hi> 3.10. Vpon <hi>Othni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and upon <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>Nahaſh.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.6. Or whether it bee ordinary gifts of government by which a man is fitted for Magiſtracy, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.6. or for Miniſteriall gifts. Or for art and skill in any mechanicall trade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.3. <hi>Bezaliel was filled with the Spirit of God to finde out curious workes to worke in gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the <hi>gifts and common graces of Illumination,</hi> as knowledge of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of religion, underſtanding of the truthes of the Goſpel, and other ſuch common graces as Reprobates may have. Thus it is taken <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.6. <hi>have taſted of the heavenly gift, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> That is, if they had their underſtandings inlightned &amp; their judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts convinced of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150587:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> if they were inlightned by the work of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, It is taken for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſanctification, for the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts of the ſpirit. And therefore it is that the name of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is given to diverſe graces, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. The <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The ſpirit of faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And the ſpirit of love,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. that is, the gift of meekneſſe, faith, love, infuſed by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning theſe <hi>graces of ſanctification,</hi> we muſt remember two Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 1. Some ſanctifying graces are radicall, originall, fundamentall graces, primary graces as they may be called, which are the immediate worke of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as faith, hope, love: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ſecondary graces iſſuing and flowing from theſe, which though the Spirit workes too, yet it workes by theſe: ſuch is joy which ariſes from faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Fill your hearts with joy in all beleeving:</hi> ſuch is confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from hope; ſuch is zeale and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150587:13"/> fervour of ſpirit ariſing from love. Theſe are, as it were, the luſtre, the ſhine, the radiancy of the radicall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall graces. They are the flame of them. There is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the coales of fire that lye on the harth, and the flame of the fire which is kindled from the coals on the harth. When a mans faith cauſes joy, then faith flames; when his hope breedes confidence, then hope flames; and when a mans love makes him zealous, then his love flames, and burnes out. They are like the body of the Sunne, and the beames of the Sunne; Faith, Hope, Love, they the <hi>body;</hi> Joy, Confidence, Zeale, they the <hi>beames</hi> of the Sunne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> Wee muſt conſider in the ſanctifying graces of the Spirit 3. things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. There are the gifts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the habits infuſed, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of faith, hope, and love.</item>
                     <item>2. There is the uſe and exerciſe and act of them.</item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:150587:14"/>
                     <item>3. There are the degrees, and ſeverall meaſures of them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God ſignifies the <hi>motions</hi> and holy <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thoſe gracious excitements to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>The Spirit blowes where it liſteth.</hi> The motions of the ſpirit are the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and the blaſts of it. And this is alſo here meant. Now ſeeing what <hi>Spirit</hi> ſignifies, we are to inquire in what ſenſe, and after what ſort the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be <hi>quenched. Quenched</hi> it may be, or elſe the counſell is in vaine, not to <hi>quench</hi> it. And againe, if it may be quenched, it may be an uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing; what comfort can a man have in having Gods Spirit, if it may be loſt? what comfort to have this fire kindled in our hearts, if ſo be it be a quenchable fire. Therefore for the clearing of this point, wee muſt know:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, take the Spirit for the ſpirit of prophecie; that may be <hi>quencht</hi> and loſt: and ſo for the gifts of government, Miniſtery, &amp;c. This Spirit may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150587:14"/> quenched. A man may have ſuch gifts much decayed and abated, yea a man may wholly loſe ſuch gifts. As it is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>the ſpirit of the Lord came upon him;</hi> ſo it is ſaid of him, that <hi>ihe Spirit of the Lord departed from him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the Spirit for the gifts &amp; common graces of illumination; and ſo the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may be quencht, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguiſhed, ſo as ſuch may quite loſe that grace that look'd like grace, and came very neere a ſaving grace. <hi>If they fall away,</hi> Heb. 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men may have all that there is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of which fall away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take the Spirit for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit, and then make uſe of this firſt diſtinction. And according to it, the radicall and fundamentall graces of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſuch as faith, hope, love, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wholly &amp; totally extinguiſhed, where once they are wrought in the heart, but yet their luſtre, their radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancie, their ſhine, and flame may bee quenched. A man though he cannot loſe his faith, yet he may loſe and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150587:15"/> want, and quench his joy. A man, though he cannot loſe his hope, yet may loſe his comfort, and confidence. A man, though he cannot loſe his love, yet may coole his zeale and fervour: Wee ſee in a fire, the wood may bee burnt out, and ſo the flame abated, and quite quenched; but yet there remains ſtill an heap of coales on the harth, and there may be a good fire ſtill, though the flame be quenched. The beames of the Sunne doe not alwayes ſhine out; a cloud may be interpoſed that may intercept the beames of the Sun, and the bright and comfortable radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſplendour of them: but yet the body of the Sunne is in heaven ſtill, though the beames be intercepted: So joy, confidence, zeale, may for a time be quenched, loſt abated, but though the flame of theſe be downe, and the beames of theſe be hindred, yet there are coales of fire in the heart, and the body of theſe is there. The flame of the ſpirit, the feeling &amp; ſenſe of it may be quenched for a time in the ſeconda-graces thereof, but yet the ſpirit it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150587:15"/> ſelfe, and the cardinall graces thereof remaine ſtill in the heart. It may bee in this, as in that caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.13. As a Teyle Tree, <hi>and as an Oake, whoſe ſubſtance is in them, when they cast their leaves.</hi> An Oake may be greene and flouriſhing all the Summer, but when Winter comes, it caſts and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the leaves, but yet when the leaves are gone, the life is not gone, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and the ſap is in it ſtill, though the leafe be gone. Faith, Hope, Love, theſe are the <hi>ſap</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of a Chriſtian; joy, confidence, zeale, theſe are his <hi>leaves.</hi> There may come a Winter, when a Chriſtian may caſt his leaves, may loſe his joy, &amp;c. but yet even then his ſubſtance and his ſap of faith, hope, and love is in him. It is one thing to loſe <hi>life,</hi> another thing to loſe a <hi>leafe.</hi> A Chriſtian may be a Teyle Tree, or an Oke without a <hi>leafe,</hi> but not without <hi>life.</hi> This we ſhall ſee plaine in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11, 12. <hi>Take not away thine holy ſpirit from me, Reſtore to me the joy ſalvation.</hi> It is cleer therefore that though <hi>David</hi> had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150587:16"/> the joy of the ſpirit quenched, yet the ſpirit ſtill unquenched: The ſpirit quenched in regard of the joy of the flame, but not quenched in regard of the fundamentall graces thereof, not in regard of the fire of it. The flame was downe, but the fire was alive. That the flame was quenched it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, becauſe he prayes, <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord kindle this flame againe, therefore the flame was quencht: But yet the ſpirit was not taken away in the fundamentall graces thereof, for he ſaith, <hi>Take not away thy ſpirit from me.</hi> If that had beene taken away, he would have ſaid, Reſtore to me thy ſpirit againe, as he doth his joy which his ſin had quencht; but ſaying, Take not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that argues that hee ſtill had the ſpirit, though the joy was gone. He was ſtill as an <hi>Oake</hi> which had caſt her <hi>leafe,</hi> he had his ſubſtance in him: he had loſt his <hi>leafe,</hi> his joy was gone, but hee had not loſt his <hi>life;</hi> Gods Spirit was ſtill in him; untaken from him.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But this may be a Doctrine of ſecurity; what care I for quenching the flame, ſo long as the fire goes not out? what care I for my <hi>joy,</hi> if I loſe not my <hi>faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Doctrine is no ground at all for ſecurity: For 1. it muſt be a mans care not onely to maintaine fire, but to maintaine flame; not only to have ſubſtance, but to have his leafe greene. The righteous muſt be a tree not only bringing forth fruit, but a <hi>Tree alſo whoſe leafe muſt not wither, Pſal.</hi> 1.3. 2. There is little comfort in <hi>life</hi> when there wants a <hi>leafe;</hi> little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in <hi>faith,</hi> when by ſinne we quench our <hi>joy.</hi> A man when he is a colde takes no pleaſure in a fire that burnes not, flames not, it does him no good to ſee the coales lye ſmothering under green wood. Though a man have the radicall graces, yet little comfort in them during the want of the other: Becauſe whilſt theſe ſecondary grace are wanting, it brings the conſcience to queſtion the preſence and truth of the primary ones. The want of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150587:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>leafe</hi> makes the conſcience queſtion the <hi>life</hi> of grace. If there were any comfort in ſuch a caſe, what needed <hi>David,</hi> having the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> beg to have his <hi>Joy</hi> reſtored? And what makes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted conſciences in time of tentation call into queſtion the truth of their fundamentall graces, but the want of their flame, of their leafe: So that this gives no way at all to carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. According to the ſecond <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, there are the infuſed habits of Faith, Hope, Love, theſe habits cannot be loſt, and ſo in regard of theſe habits the <hi>ſpirit</hi> cannot be quencht.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is the act, uſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of them: In that regard the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may be quenched: For though the habit of faith cannot be killed, yet the act, uſe, and exerciſe of it may bee deaded, ſo as it may not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent act and worke, and a man not uſe it. A man in his drunkenneſſe loſeth the uſe, but not the faculty of Reaſon. A man in his ſleepe loſeth the uſe, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150587:17"/> not the faculty of his ſenſe. Sinne and temptation may as much diſtemper the ſoule, as Wine and ſtrong drinke may doe the braine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the meaſure and degree, in that regard the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may be quencht. A man may come to have a leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of faith, hope, love, a leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of joy and zeale. The degrees of theſe may be abated, and yet the things themſelves remaine, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.4. It is laid to the charge of the Angel of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, That he had loſt his firſt love;</hi> he ſayes not, he had loſt his love, or all his love, but his firſt love, that degree of love he had at firſt; he had love ſtill, but it was not ſo fervent as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was abated in the degree of it, and ſo the <hi>ſpirit</hi> was quenched in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. So then, looke upon the habits of grace, and in regard of the habit, there is no <hi>amiſsion</hi> of grace: Looke upon the act, and in regard of the act, there may bee an <hi>intermiſsion</hi> of it: Looke upon the degree, and in regard of the degree, there may be a <hi>remiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> A <hi>remiſsion</hi> of degrees, an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:150587:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> of acts, but no utter <hi>amiſsion</hi> of habits, of fundamentall ſaving ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace. And thus having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and cleared the Text, come wee now to ſome obſervations.</p>
                  <p>And here firſt begin with the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> And out of it learne</p>
                  <p>The nature of the Spirit of God, and ſpirit of grace. That the ſpirit of God is of the nature of fire: ſo much the word <hi>quench</hi> implyes, for nothing is properly quenched but fire; <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> is as much as quench not the fire of the ſpirit. The Spirit of God then is of the nature of fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> that is, with the Holy Spirit which is as fire, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.49. <hi>Every man ſhall be ſalted with fire:</hi> what fire? As the fire of afflictions, and the the fire of the word, ſo the fire of the ſpirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>There appeared to them cloven tongues with fire, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Spirit</hi> is compared to water, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. And ſometimes againe to fire.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150587:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> As the Word of God is a fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>Is not my Word a fire?</hi> ſo is his Spirit a fire. Is not my Spirit a fire? And the Spirit is compared to fire in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Fire, it gives <hi>light:</hi> And therefore in the want of the light of the Sunne, we make uſe of fire to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us light for doing our workes. The Sunne was not created till the fourth day, and yet there was light all the three firſt dayes, which ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to have beene from the element of fire under the ſphere of the Moone, which gave light unto the world. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. <hi>They had a piller of fire by night to give them light:</hi> Fire and light goe together. So is it with the Spirit of God. It is a Spirit of light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18. All ſpirituall illumination comes from this fire. Gods Spirit is an inlightning ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man perceiveth not the things of God; neither can he, becauſe they be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned,</hi> viz. by the light of the Spirit, which Spirit a naturall man wanting, hee is in the darke for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150587:19"/> want of light that ſhould ſhew unto him divine truths. The Spirit of God is fire that brings light with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Gods Spirit comes there comes light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, fire as it gives light, ſo it alſo gives <hi>heate;</hi> fire and heate are inſeparable: when our bodies are pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with cold in the winter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the fire wee are warmed and heated; fire warmes and heates that which is cold, and by the heat of it thawes and melts that which is frozen. Thus is it with the Spirit of God, it is an heating warming Spirit, it warmes and heates the affections, our hearts that are frozen and cold in prayer, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it heates and warmes them, it melts and inlarges them. It kindles both affections of love, zeale, Joy. The Spirit of God will make a mans heart burne within, in the hearing of the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us when he opened the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> It will make a mans heart glow and flame in prayer, it will melt a mans heart, and make it drop at a mans eyes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150587:19"/> as Ice thawes and drops againſt the fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Fire as it heates and warmes, ſo it alſo <hi>burnes and conſumes</hi> whatever combuſtible matter it lights and layes hold upon: It feedes upon combuſtible matter, and leaves not till it have brought it into aſhes. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.16. Fire is one of the <hi>foure things that never ſayes it is enough.</hi> A little ſparke of fire burnes downe and conſumes whole houſes and Townes. It is ever in action, and eating up and conſuming what it lights upon. So is it with the Spirit of God and the graces of it: When the Spirit of God comes once into a mans heart, looke what combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter it findes there, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes and eates it up: it will conſume and burne up our luſts and corruptions. It will doe with the body of ſinne, as the King of <hi>Moab</hi> did with the King of <hi>Edom, Am.</hi> 2.1. <hi>He burnt the bones of the King of Edom into lyme;</hi> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts did with Gods ſervants in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, burnes the body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into aſhes.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>The meanes to keepe us from quenching, and to kindle and keepe</hi> it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and burning in us, are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Firſt, to be carefull and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to quench it, but to cheriſh it in the firſt motions thereof. Quench not the Spirit. Quench not the firſt motions thereof. Quench not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that is, foſter, cheriſh, and make much of the firſt motions of the Spirit. In the firſt creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. it is ſaid the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water, or was moving. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubabat aquis,</hi> ſayes <hi>Junius, viz.</hi> as Birds upon their egges, or young. They ſit and are moving upon them to hatch them and bring them forth; and when they are hatcht, they ſtill ſit and move upon them to cheriſh, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150587:25"/> ſuſtaine them with their heate and warmth, till they bring them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So the Spirit of God did ſit or move upon that face of the deepe, by his motion or incubation, to hatch and bring forth out of that vaſt maſſe the ſeverall kinds of creatures, he by an effectuall and comfortable motion cheriſhed that matter, till he brought forth the ſeverall creatures, till hee hatcht them and brought them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Now looke as the Spirit in the creation moved upon the waters, juſt in the ſame manner the Spirit moves in mens hearts, that by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious motions of his Spirit, hee may hatch and bring forth graces, and good workes in us, and may bring them to perfection. The ſame word is uſed of God againe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11. <hi>As the Eagle flutters over her young, ſo the Lord alone, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord as an Eagle over her young, flutter'd over his people, or moves, <hi>As the Eagle ſtirres up her nest,</hi> that is, <hi>her young ones.</hi> The Eagle, ſhee ſtirres up her young ones, and rowſes them up with her cry, and not onely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150587:25"/> ſits upon them, but flutters over them with her wings to awaken them: So did God ſtirre up <hi>Iſrael</hi> to goe out of the land of <hi>Aegypt, Ezek.</hi> 20.5, 6, 7. So that before God brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he firſt ſtirred them up to be gone; He ſaid unto them, Caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way every man his abomination. Now how did God ſtirre them up? Not onely by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, but by the gracious motions and ſollicitations of his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and thoſe motions by which hee ſtirred them up and called upon them to bee gone, and to caſt away their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thoſe were the Eagles ſtirrings of her neſt; theſe were the Eagles flutterings with her wings: As the Eagle ſtirres up her neſt; how ſtirres ſhe up her neſt, her young ones? She rowſes them by her cry: So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit rowſes, excites, and ſtirres up men by his voyce in the motions thereof: And therefore thoſe motions are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a voyce, though not a voyce audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the bodily eare, yet audible and ſenſible to the ſoule, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Thine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150587:26"/> eares ſhall heare a word behind thee.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, as <hi>Iohn, Apoc.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I heard a voyce behind me,</hi> not before me, as implying that the Spirit of God comes and calls upon us being ſecure, paſſing by, and not regarding thoſe things it calls for. It is a voyce that many times comes all on a ſudden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. <hi>The voyce of my Beloved, behold hee comes.</hi> It is a ſecret whiſpering voyce, breathing holy motions into our hearts, ſtirring us up to ſome good: But yet it is a preſſing voyce, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a man, and preſſes him cloſe to what it calls for, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Paul was preſſed in ſpirit, and teſtified, &amp;c.</hi> The Spirit of God moved him, and ſtirred up his ſpirit, and forcibly and ſtrongly moved him, ſo as his ſpirit was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe: All this was, that he had ſtrong and vehement motions from Gods Spirit to doe that which he did. Now then, when we have ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch breathings, ſtirrings, flutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, then ſhould our care be not to quench theſe, but to cheriſh, kindle, and uphold theſe motions. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150587:26"/> of God is fire, the motions of the ſpirit, are the ſparkes of this fire; now our care ſhould be not to <hi>quench</hi> theſe ſparkes, not to let them goe out, but to kindle and cheriſh them unto a great fire, unto flame. It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he will not quench the ſmoaking flaxe.</hi> That if there be in a mans heart but a ſmall ſparke of grace, ſo ſmall that it burnes not, but onely makes a little ſmoake, and a poore ſmother, yet he will not quench it, but he will make much of it, cheriſh and foſter it till it kindle and grow to a great fire: So ſhould it be with us, when the Spirit of God injects and caſts into our hearts but the ſparkes of fire in the gracious motions thereof, quench not thoſe ſparkes, cheriſh and kindle thoſe ſparkes, keepe them from <hi>quenching</hi> and dying, and going out.</p>
                  <p>Now for the doing of theſe two things are required: Firſt, have a care to take notice of the motions of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> watch where hee moves and ſtirres, that a good motion may no ſooner ſtirre in thine heart, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150587:27"/> thou maiſt preſently be able to ſay, This is Gods Spirit, theſe be the flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings of the Eagles wings, this good motion is from Gods Spirit. Thus doth the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. whilſt ſhe is in that holy diſcourſe, ſhe findes a good motion ſtirring, and abruptly ſhe breakes off, and ſayes, <hi>The voyce of my welbeloved.</hi> Now Chriſt ſpeakes by the good motions of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is that, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I heard a voyce behind me,</hi> and verſ. 12. <hi>And I turned to ſee the voyce that ſpake with me.</hi> The <hi>voyce</hi> was behinde him at his backe; now when he heares the <hi>voyce</hi> behinde him, he does not goe on, and never minde, and not vouchſafe once to looke backe and to heed it, but hee turnes him about to ſee the <hi>voyce</hi> that ſpake with him, to take more ſpeciall notice of what was ſaid: So when we heare that voyce of the Spirit in the motions of it, and heare it behinde us, we ſhould not goe on negligently and careleſly, and leave and caſt it behinde our backes, but turne about to ſee the <hi>voyce,</hi> take ſpeciall and ſerious notice
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150587:27"/> of it. Doe as the people did at the poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> they ſate watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the mooving of the waters by the Angel, that the waters could no ſooner move, but preſently they ſaw it, obſerved it, tooke notice of it, and all cryed out the Angel moves in the waters. So ſhould we watch when at any time the ſpirit of God moves in our hearts, and take ſpeciall notice of it; and ſay, now Gods ſpirit ſpeakes to mee, this is the <hi>voyce</hi> of the ſpirit. That when a good motion ſtirres in our hearts, we might be able to ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> upon his dreame, ſurely God is here, ſurely Gods ſpirit is here. This were a great meanes to kindle the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in us, and to make him continue his gratious counſells to us, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is a ſhrewd meanes to quench the ſpirit. If a man ſpeake to us, and give us good counſell, and adviſe for our benefit, if we hearken and give eare to him, and take notice of what he ſayes, then he will go on, and give us further information and direction; but if hee perceives that we regard him not, that

                  <p>Wee ſhall ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. that God called <hi>Samuel</hi> three times, and <hi>Samuel</hi> thought it had beene <hi>Ely,</hi> and doth not take notice of it that it was the Lord: And all that while that hee takes not notice of it to bee the Lord, all that while God is ſilent, ſayes no more to him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municates not his mind to him.

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, in the gift and grace of faith. The way to keepe faith in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, in life, to keepe it from quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the deſire, to make it grow and increaſe, is to put faith to it, to keepe it in action, to keepe it in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and to make it put forth it ſelfe in frequent acts. So long as faith is on the increaſing hand, ſo long no feare of its quenching or decaying; ſo long as faith is acted and in exerciſe, ſo long it is on the increaſing hand; every new and freſh act of faith adds growth and increaſe to it: the uſe of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes faith; and the more freſh acts of beleeving, the more the habit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving is increaſed: Many acts ſtrengthen and increaſe habits. Marke how that man ſpeakes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. Chriſt tells him, if hee can beleeve, hee can heale his childe: Lord ſayes he, <hi>helpe my unbeliefe;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Lord I would faine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150587:37"/> I finde much unbeliefe, helpe me to overcome it. I but firſt, ſayes he, <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe my unbeliefe.</hi> That act of his in putting forth his faith to beleeve as he could, was the way to overcome his unbeliefe, and to come to beleeve as he would. The way to have the faith we would have, is to uſe and ſet on worke the faith we already have. See <hi>John</hi> 1.48, 49, 50, 51. as if he ſhould ſay, Since thou art ſo ready to beleeve upon ſo ſmall a ground, therefore thou ſhalt ſee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then theſe. Great matters ſhall be revealed unto thee, that ſhall ſet thy faith on worke in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The way then to keepe faith in vigour and in life, is to ſet faith fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on worke, and to have it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and forward to beleeve. Take the promiſes, and ſet them before thee, and put thy faith on worke upon them, and ſtirre up thine heart to beleeve them ſtrive to act thy faith in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, and this will keepe thy faith <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>vigorous.</hi> When faith is not exerciſed, and ſet, and kept to

If our eyes ſee not our teachers, we cannot expect wee ſhould heare the voyce behind us. The way to have the ſpirit follow, us with his motions, and worke of grace, is for us to follow the word. The hearing of the word then is a ſpeciall meanes to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150587:42"/> cheriſh the ſpirit of grace in our hearts. It is the oyle, and the wood that keepes this fire burning.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo the <hi>bellowes</hi> that blowes and ſtirres up this fire in our hearts. When a man would kindle a firc hee takes the bellowes, and by their helpe hee makes the fire burne with a great flame, and heate, that before burnt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing. When a fire is quencht, and is almoſt out, the <hi>bellowes</hi> will quickly raiſe the flame againe. The miniſtry of the word is the <hi>bellowes</hi> that blowes up and kindles the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in us and makes it flame. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.29. All the preaching of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is in vaine, it will not prevaile with them: Therefore when the word is preached, then the <hi>Bellowes blowes</hi> to kindle the fire. Now when there is fire, and fuell, and bellowes blowing, there is no danger of the fyre going out, there is no queſtion but that the fire will burne and be kept alive. And the miniſtry of the word being <hi>fire, fuell, and bellowes,</hi> it muſt needs bee a ſpeciall meanes to keepe the Spirit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150587:43"/> from quenching, to kindle and keepe it alive in us. And therefore ſuch as would take heede of quenching, as would kindle and preſerve this fire burning, they muſt come to this fire, and catch fire at it, muſt lay on this wood, muſt come under the blaſt of theſe bellowes: that is, they muſt come to, and attend upon the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word. And what is it that more and ſooner quenches the Spirit then the want, and neglect of the miniſtry of the word. Many that have had faire lamps blazing, faire fires bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet it comes to paſſe that it may be ſaid of them, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.17. <hi>They are extinct, they are quenched as towe.</hi> When wood burnes, &amp; after quenches yet for ſome good time after there remaine ſome coales, and ſome fire ſtill, but when burning towe quenches it leaves no fire or heate at all, it goes ſuddenly quite out. So many, not onely quench in degree, but quench altogether, <hi>quench as towe. Quench</hi> ſo as God in another ſenſe threatens to quench the wicked, <hi>Iob</hi> 18.5.6. <hi>Their

And Secondly, Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, who when hee ſees men begin to neglect and ſhift the meanes, hee will in his wrath ſmite them with the loſſe of thoſe gifts and graces they had.

In blowing of the fire, the ſmaller wood takes fire firſt, and that being fired, it fires the greater wood. Many times men that have greater meaſures of gifts and knowledge, may want heat and be ſhort in their fervour and zeale, and they by their communion with Chriſtians of meaner ranke, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gifts than themſelves, may bee warmed, and heated, and have the fire of love and zeale kindled in them. We ſee that greene wood will hardly burn alone; lay that on the fire alone, and what a deale of blowing and ſtirring muſt there be ere it will take fire; and if it doe take fire, it will hardly burne any longer than it is blowne, and but poorly then neither: But now lay green wood on the fire with dry wood, and the dry wood not onely burnes it ſelfe, but ſets the greene wood on fire alſo, and makes it burne to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Some mens hearts are exceeding

                  <p>A live cole thrown out of the fire dies and quenches preſently: A dead cole caſt into the fire amongſt coales that are alive, preſently is on fire: And this very thing <hi>Salomon</hi> intends, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.11. <hi>If two ly together, then they have heat.</hi> There is a mutuall contribution and communication of heate from each to other: One gives heate to another,<note place="margin">Alter cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidus, alter frigidus.

Cloathes were dead cheriſhers, they could not warm <hi>David;</hi> but <hi>Abiſhag</hi> having naturall and living heat, this helpt <hi>David</hi> to warmth: So here, if men doe uſe meanes in private by themſelves, and have not exerciſe, nor communion with others, all meanes ſo uſed will be but covering with clothes, by which wee ſhall neither get, nor keepe heate.

By which he implyes that as a ſpeciall meanes to keep men from ſuch a quenching of the Spirit, as makes way to the ſinne againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, is to uphold the practiſe of the duties of the communion of Saints: ſo a ſpeciall cauſe of ſuch quenching as makes way unto that ſinne, is the <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>throwing</hi> up of the practiſe of the duties of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the duty of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though there be wood and fire,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150587:48"/> yet if they be not laid one to another, there will be no <hi>flame</hi> nor <hi>heate,</hi> but when they are laid and applyed each to other, that <hi>kindles and makes the fire burne,</hi> eſpecially when the fire is blowne upon the wood being laid on. Meditation layes wood and fire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it blowes the fire alſo, and raiſes the flame. All the prodigall ſonnes graces began at this, <hi>I will ariſe,</hi> ſaid hee; (he ſaid it in his heart, in his thoughts, in his meditations) <hi>and goe to my Father:</hi> He was in ſerious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, what a great man his Father was, what an excellent houſe he kept, what a miſerable caſe he himſelfe was in; and this meditation <hi>quickned</hi> his heart to this, <hi>I will ariſe and goe to my Father:</hi> So mens bethinking themſelves is made an excellent helpe unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.47. That is when men ſeriouſly uſe to meditate, and uſe to thinke with themſelves what they have done, how God is offended with them, how great their miſery is, where remedy is to be had, &amp;c. This is an excellent helpe to make way for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150587:49"/> the ſpirit of repentance. It is a great meaſure of grace the godly man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. But marke what is a great meanes conducing to theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace, and the ſpirit, verſe 2. <hi>To bee ſpiritually minded is life, Rom.</hi> 8.6. This is in one ſenſe to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tually minded, when the mind is imployed in ſpirituall meditations, and this is life alſo in this ſenſe, in that it breedes and maintaines the life of grace and the ſpirit in us. The want and neglect of this duty, doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <hi>chill,</hi> and <hi>coole,</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> the <hi>graces</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in us, therefore as we would not <hi>quench,</hi> but <hi>keepe alive</hi> the <hi>graces</hi> of God in us, ſo exerciſe we our hearts often in the duty of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Prayer a meanes to keepe the ſpirit from quenching</note>4. Fourthly, the duty of prayer. It is a ſpeciall meanes to keepe the <hi>Spirit</hi> from <hi>quenching,</hi> ye to cauſe the ſpirit to kindle and increaſe in us, to bee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and feruent in prayer. It is that by which we get the <hi>Spirit encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> in us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.17. <hi>how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy

For a man (to ſpeake properly) cannot pray till he have the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and then when a man hath the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſets that Spirit on worke in the duty of prayer, then the ſpirit which was given before, is given in a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in greater abundance in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof. The Apoſtles had the ſpirit of God in them before Chriſts death, and after his reſurrection, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. <hi>he breathed upon them and ſayd, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And yet after this it is ſaid that they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt: that is, at that time the Holy Ghoſt came upon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh. But when was it that they were afreſh filled with the Holy Ghoſt? Prayer brought downe a fulneſſe of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> That ſpeech <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. is conceived to bee the ſpeech of Chriſt, as if he ſhould ſay, oh my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit blow upon the hearts of my people, that their graces may abound in them,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150587:50"/> and increaſe in them, worke abundance of grace in them. It is ſure, that the ſpirit of God muſt blow upon the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before the <hi>ſpices</hi> thereof can <hi>flow</hi> out, before the <hi>graces</hi> can <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>abound.</hi> But yet there muſt bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what done before the North winde doth awake, and this South winde blowes. Not only the voyce of Chriſt muſt ſtirre up, and raiſe this winde, but the voyce of prayer on our parts muſt raiſe the winde. <hi>The ſpirit blowes where it lists,</hi> but yet there is a way to raiſe this winde ſo to blow, that ſpices may flow out. Then when we are <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> in <hi>prayer,</hi> then when our <hi>hearts are enlarged in prayer,</hi> then Chriſt ſtirres up his <hi>ſpirit to blow,</hi> then hee <hi>raiſes</hi> that <hi>winde</hi> to <hi>make the ſpices flow out.</hi> If <hi>ſpices flow</hi> not out, if <hi>graces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound</hi> not, it is becauſe the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South winde blowes not.</hi> If they blow not, it is becauſe Chriſt ſtirres not, nor awakens them. As hee rebuked the windes, and they were ſtill, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. ſo when hee commandes theſe windes, they blowe. And if Chriſt <hi>awake</hi> not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150587:50"/> this <hi>wind,</hi> it is becauſe wee awake not <hi>him</hi> by prayer: when they awakened him <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. hee ſtilled thoſe windes, and when we awaken him, hee will A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken, and ſtirre up this winde to <hi>blow</hi> ſo, as the ſweet ſpices of his graces may <hi>flow</hi> out. All riſes to this, that the more wee have our hearts enlarged in prayer, the more will the Lord enlarge his hands in the graces of the <hi>Spirit. Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81.10. The <hi>wide</hi> mouth proves the <hi>full</hi> mouth, the <hi>wider</hi> the <hi>fuller.</hi> The more our hearts and deſires are enlarged in prayer, the fuller of the graces of the ſpirit ſhall our hearts bee. Prayer will helpe us to every grace, and cauſe every grace to increaſe in us. It will helpe us to a ſpirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and underſtanding, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21.22. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.25, 26.

It is that which helpes to ſpirituall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>James</hi> 1.5. and to the increaſe of faith.

As therefore wee would keepe the <hi>ſpirit</hi> from <hi>quenching,</hi> as wee would keepe it alive, and increaſe it, ſo we muſt be frequent &amp; diligent, &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in the duty of prayer: grace ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abate, nor decay, or dye, ſo long as we

Juſt ſuch is the caſe of ſuch as commit groſſe ſinnes, againſt <hi>conſcience</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Sinning and praying can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together: If praying doe not hinder from ſinning, ſinning will hinder from praying.

The Prophet complains of the Prieſts and Prophets in his time, that they had loſt the knowledge of the truth, that light was quencht: But how came it ſo? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.7. they were a company of drunken ſots: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10.12.

                  <p>It is with the love of the earth, as it is with the Dampe of the earth.

The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the world againſt a Chriſtian, is not ſo dangerous to quench the love of God, as is our owne inordinate love of the world. Perſecutions <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> Whileſt the perſecutors in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes kindled the fires, it did withall <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in love and zeale the more in their hearts. But the loving of the world, that damps and extinguiſhes this fire. As therefore wee would take heede of quenching the Spirit, ſo take we heede of the love of the world, if once that creepe upon you and get hold on you, you are in great danger of <hi>quenching the ſpirit.</hi> What is the reaſon that it is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150587:57"/> with many Chriſtians as it was with <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Jmage? <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32.33. This Jmages head was of fine gold, his feete part of yron, part of clay: a great deale of difference betweene the head of the Jmage, and the feete of it. So you have many in their young time, in their firſt beginnings, that ſeemed to bee golden Chriſtians, full of life, full of zeale, full of good; But in their elder age are cold, dead, brazen little life or vigour in them: their feet part of yron, part of clay. What is the reaſon that they that began with a golden head have feete of clay? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they came to have hearts of clay, and they did <hi>loade themſelves with thick clay, Hab.</hi> 2. They by degrees ſuffered the earth, and the love of it, to creepe into their hearts; And ſo having clayie hearts, their golden heads have had clayie feet. The <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> being therefore gotten into their hearts, hath <hi>quencht</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God in them, and they have growne cold, and dead hearted in their old age, in which the trees of Gods plantation uſe to bee
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150587:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt fruitfull. Therefore as we would take heede of <hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> ſo take wee heede of an earthly heart, of the beſotting, and bewitching love of the world.</p>

And ſo they that love the Lord, they are like the Sunne ſhining and going forth in his might, becauſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150587:59"/> they doe all they doe, <hi>with all their might,</hi> and that fills them with <hi>heate:</hi> But on the other ſide, when men pray, heare, &amp;c. and doe duties ſlothfully, ſluggiſhly, and with formality of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that <hi>quenches,</hi> and damps, and cooles the <hi>ſpirit of grace</hi> in a man.

                  <p>The Apoſtles counſell to <hi>Timothy</hi> is, to <hi>ſtirre up the grace of God</hi> that was in him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. ſo long as it is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, it is out of danger of quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and dying.

                  <p>There be two ſeverall paces in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and performance of religious duties, and we finde them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.12. <hi>When thou goeſt thy ſteps ſhall not be ſtraightned, and when thou runneſt thou ſhalt not ſtumble.</hi> There is a going pace, and there is a running pace: A man muſt firſt goe before hee can run, and when a man begins with a

When a man begins to practiſe and performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is a going, but when he comes to be zealous, and fervent in duties of obedience and ſervice, that's running; running is the pace of zeale: Now ſo long as a man keepes running, ſo long he keepes warmth and heate in him, though it be cold weather: So long as a man is zealous in the profeſſion of Religion, and performance of duties, ſo long the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> burnes, and is not <hi>quenched:</hi> But if a man leave run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſlacks his pace, and contents himſelfe with a going pace, his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heate <hi>abates,</hi> and is <hi>cooled,</hi> and <hi>quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</hi> And when a man hath beene zealous in profeſſion, and zealous in performances, and afterwards falls to formality, that's to turne running into going, and that's the way to <hi>coole</hi> and <hi>quench the ſpirit.</hi> It is formality in Religion that undoes men, that's the cauſe the <hi>ſpirit</hi> kindles not in ſome, that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is <hi>quenched</hi> in others.

                  </p>
                  <p>The next way to <hi>quench the ſpirit</hi> is to quench a mans cares, deſires, and endeavours after more grace.

                  <p>If a man have a good eſtate, yet if he thinks that he hath not yet enough, but hee yet wants ſo much and ſo much, that very opinion that he hath not enough, <hi>quickens</hi> his <hi>cares for,</hi> his <hi>deſires of,</hi> his <hi>endeavours after</hi> more, and ſo makes him <hi>ply</hi> his <hi>trading, ply</hi> his <hi>Markets</hi> yet to get more. And his

So a man that hath good meaſures of grace already, yet if hee thinke that hee is ſhort of that hee ſhould be, and have, he hath not yet thoſe meaſures of knowledge, faith, zeale, &amp;c. he ſhould have; that very thought <hi>quickens</hi> his <hi>cares, deſires,</hi> and <hi>endaavours</hi> to get more, and theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours increaſe his ſtocke.</p>

                  <p>When a man thinkes hee hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, goods and riches enough for him and his, he cares not for any more, he will not ride and runne about, and

                  <p n="3">3. Point. The danger of quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Spirit. <hi>There is a great deale of danger in quenching the Spirit, ſo great, as may make any wiſe man fearefull how he doth it. David</hi> being in battell with the Philiſtines, and being in danger of being ſlaine by <hi>Iſhbi-benob</hi> the Gyant, was reſcued by <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> which danger being eſcaped, <hi>The men of David ſware unto him, ſaying, Thou ſhalt goe no more with us out to battell, that thou quench not the light of Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.17. It had beene a ſad, and a dangerous thing to have had the <hi>light of Iſfrael quenched,</hi> and therefore they would provide wiſely another time againſt that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; And it is no little danger that followes upon <hi>the quenching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> It is good therefore to know the <hi>danger</hi> of it, that the danger of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne, we may take the greater heed thereof, and feare the more to <hi>quench the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The danger of <hi>quenching the Spirit</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:150587:68"/> in the motions and ſollicitations of it, that is two-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of Gods help and aſſiſtance.</note> when a man quenches the Spirit in the motions of it, either by not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, or not obeying them, that he doth not marke them, and yeeld a preſent obedience to them, hee then looſes the helpe and aſſiſtance of the Spirit which he might have had in the doing of thoſe things hee was moved to, which helpe he might have had, if he had then liſtned to the motions of the Spirit. This is a ſure truth, that whenſoever the Spirit of God moves a man to any good duty, as to <hi>beleeve,</hi> to <hi>repent,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>heare,</hi> to performe any difficult duty of obedience, that whenſoever he moves to ſuch duties, he alſo offers his <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>asſiſtance</hi> ſo as to <hi>enable</hi> us unto them, and to <hi>carry</hi> us thorow them; as if he ſhould ſay, Doe that which I move you to, ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and goe about it now I call upon you to doe it, and I that move you will alſo <hi>helpe</hi> you. <hi>Hearken</hi> to my counſell, and you ſhall have mine <hi>helpe</hi> to carry you thorow the work, though
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:150587:69"/> it be an hard worke. If you will <hi>cloſe</hi> with me in my <hi>motion,</hi> I will <hi>cloſe</hi> with you in the <hi>action.</hi> The <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are not <hi>bare motions,</hi> but there is alwayes annext to them <hi>offers of helpe,</hi> and the motions being hearkned to, the helpe of the ſpirit goes along with them. Motions of grace have offers of grace, motions of the Spirit have the helpe of the Spirit offered with them.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of God moves a man to <hi>beleeve, repent,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> &amp;c. Now when he moves thee to doe theſe things, at the ſame time he offers his <hi>helpe</hi> for the doing of them, he offers his <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>asſiſtance</hi> to <hi>beleeve,</hi> to <hi>repent,</hi> to <hi>pray.</hi> And a man that takes the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath alſo his <hi>helpe,</hi> and is <hi>enabled</hi> by him to <hi>doe</hi> theſe things.</p>
                  <p>As in that caſe <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.17. <hi>As he was teaching, the power of God was preſent to heale them:</hi> So it is in the motions of the Spirit, as he is <hi>teaching, urging, preſsing</hi> us to any duty, <hi>the power of the Lord is juſt then preſent</hi> to <hi>helpe</hi> a man,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150587:69"/> and the man that hearkens to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſhall be ſure to have that <hi>helpe</hi> of the <hi>power of God</hi> that is then <hi>preſent.</hi> As there in that caſe, <hi>The power of the Lord was preſent then to heale them, as he was teaching:</hi> And ſee what followed upon it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>And behold men brought in a bed a man taken with the palſey:</hi> When did they bring him?

He that was brought in his bed, walkes away with his bed, and goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whole. So happy a thing it is to take the advantage of Gods helpe when <hi>his power is preſent to helpe.</hi> Juſt ſo it is in the <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> when he <hi>moves</hi> to <hi>repentance, his power is preſent to help</hi> a man to <hi>repent.</hi> And let a man then beſtirre himſelfe, and though he have as little power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent as the palſey man had to walke, yet the power of God, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the motion made, will doe as much for his ſoule, as it did for that mans body.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:150587:70"/>
                  <p>See 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 14.15.16. <hi>When David ſhould heare a ſound of going in the tops of the Mulberry Trees, then he muſt goe out to battell, for then God was preſent with his power to ſmite the Philiſtines.</hi> Well, <hi>David</hi> did ſo as God commanded him, juſt when he heares the ſound of goings hee goes out, juſt then; and what was the ſucceſſe? <hi>And they ſmote the Hoſt of the Philiſtines.</hi> Hee tooke the advantage of Gods preſence and power that was then preſent to helpe him, and ſo hee did the deede, went thorow happily with the worke. When we have <hi>motions</hi> from <hi>Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to <hi>beleeve, repent, pray,</hi> theſe be the ſound of his <hi>goings,</hi> why then ſet upon theſe duties. But alas! they be hard things; alas!

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:150587:70"/> prayer, &amp;c. Doe therefore as the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God <hi>moves</hi> thee, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> thee, and thou ſhalt have the <hi>victory</hi> over thine <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> over thine <hi>impenitency,</hi> &amp;c. then thou ſhalt bee ſure to have the helpe of the Spirit, if thou wilt inſtantly <hi>hearken</hi> to the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit.</hi> See how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Salomon</hi> about building of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ariſe, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee. Ariſe Salomon,</hi> and <hi>be</hi> building and doing, and the Lord helpe thee. It is moſt certaine, that when the Spirit of God doth ſay to men, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> and <hi>bee doing,</hi> that then if men will <hi>ariſe</hi> and be <hi>doing</hi> when he calls them to be <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that the Spirit of the Lord <hi>will be with them</hi> to <hi>helpe</hi> them and <hi>aſsist</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But now when men <hi>quench the ſpirit of God</hi> in theſe <hi>motions,</hi> and doe not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> them, nor <hi>hearken</hi> to them, and <hi>yeeld</hi> a preſent <hi>obedience</hi> to them, here is the danger of it, that they <hi>loſe</hi> this <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>asſiſtance</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which then was to be had, and ſo when after
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150587:71"/> they would doe theſe things they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe them, becauſe now they muſt doe them alone, and by their owne ſtrength; and their own ſtrength is too weake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> went out againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines juſt when he heard the ſound of <hi>goings in the top of the Mulberry trees, and ſo he ſmites the Philiſtines;</hi> and why ſo? Becauſe when the ſound of the goings was, then <hi>God was preſent to help him:</hi> But now ſuppoſe <hi>David</hi> when he had heard that <hi>ſound of the goings</hi> had ſat ſtill, and had ſaid with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, There is no ſuch haſte of going out againſt the Philiſtines, ſuppoſe he had put it off till next day, or for a matter of 3. or 4. houres; what would have beene the iſſue? Aſſuredly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had not beate the Philiſtines, he had loſt the day if he had but put it off but one day, an hundred to one but if he had delayed his going out ſome few houres, but the Philiſtines had beate him to clouts.</p>
                  <p>And this very thing is that which <hi>undoes</hi> men, and a maine reaſon that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150587:71"/> they never come to <hi>beleeve, repent,</hi> &amp;c. Gods <hi>Spirit moves</hi> to theſe things, and when he makes the <hi>motion,</hi> hee <hi>offers</hi> his <hi>helpe;</hi> and men they <hi>put</hi> off theſe <hi>motions,</hi> they will ſet upon <hi>faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, obedience,</hi> and they will <hi>pray,</hi> but at this time they cannot ſo well doe it. At ſuch a time they will doe their things: And when they come at theſe they <hi>cannot</hi> for their lives <hi>repent</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> they finde the worke utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, which might have beene poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if they had ſet upon it when <hi>Gods</hi> ſpirit counſelled to it, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the time in which <hi>God</hi> help was to be had: So that the <hi>quenching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is the <hi>loſing</hi> of Gods <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistance</hi> in duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore and knocke, Apoc.</hi> 3. <hi>If any man will open.</hi> Alas! we cannot open the doore, it is ſo locked, and barred, and bolted, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to open it. True, it is ſo, but yet there is a way to <hi>open,</hi> and that is to be opening when God would helpe us to open. When God offers to helpe thee to <hi>open the doore,</hi> then ſet
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150587:72"/> upon opening the doore, and what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bolts, barres, and lockes are, thou ſhalt bee ſure to have it open.</p>
                  <p>I but when doth God offer to help us to open it? Then when his Spirit <hi>knocks,</hi> when in the motions thereof he ſollicites us to <hi>open,</hi> then God offers his help to help us to <hi>open.</hi> Take that time, and then ſet on the work, and the <hi>doore</hi> ſhall be <hi>opened.</hi> But if that time be neglected, we may ſtrive to <hi>open</hi> but cannot <hi>open,</hi> becauſe then that power is gone that would have helpt us to <hi>open.</hi> See <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Man alſo knowes not his time.</hi> This is one cauſe of mans miſery, that hee <hi>knowes not his time,</hi> that he miſſes the time of doing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt good. Not to ſtrike in and cloſe with God when hee offers his helpe, is to miſſe our time, and this makes us miſerable. And this miſery of miſſing our time is the fruit of <hi>quenehing the ſpirit.</hi> The time of Gods helpe is the time of his Spirits ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. They that neglect the time of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150587:72"/> the Spirits motions, they neglect <hi>Gods</hi> time of helpe; they that loſe the time of Gods helpe, loſe ability and power to doe Gods worke. <hi>To day if ye will heare his voyce, &amp;c.</hi> What then? <hi>Heare his voyce to day,</hi> and then <hi>to day</hi> he will helpe you. But when men <hi>heare</hi> not his voyce <hi>to day,</hi> but will ſtay till to <hi>morrow,</hi> and <hi>next day,</hi> and I know not how many dayes, and ſo put off Gods Spirit, they doe thereby put out Gods Spirit, and ſo loſe that helpe and aſſiſtance of the Spirit they might have had. This is that one danger of <hi>quenching the Spirit</hi> in the motions of it, wee thereby loſe the <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> of the Spirit in holy duties of obedience.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150587:73"/> gone.</hi> Her <hi>Wel-beloved had withdrawne himſelfe, and was gone,</hi> and now her <hi>ſoule</hi> was departed and <hi>gone,</hi> ſhe was as a dead woman through feare and grief. See what a dangerous thing it is to <hi>quench the Spirit;</hi> ſad things follow upon it. Well, but then why doth ſhe not ſeeke to recover all againe?

Now, how could ſuch a man tell whether ever the Angel would move againe or no? There was a time when that miracle ceaſed, there was a motion of the Angel which was his laſt motion; There was a motion after which there was never any motion more. Now then, how could ſuch a man tell, but that motion which hee neglected might be the laſt? For ought he could tell, the Angel might never deſcend into the Poole more, might never make a motion in the waters
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150587:75"/> more: So when we <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>quench the Spirit of God</hi> in the motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who can tell whether ever the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God will doe him that favour any more? whether he will ever dart any of thoſe ſparkes of that heavenly fire into his heart or no? when he hath ſo fooliſhly quencht them. The <hi>quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the ſpirit</hi> may juſtly provoke him to ceaſe his worke, and to ſtirre no more.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſure thing, that the Spirit of God unkindly uſed will forbeare, and will be gone, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. <hi>Yee ſhall heare a word behind you, &amp;c.</hi> The ſtopping of our eares againſt his motions, will at laſt prove the ſtopping of his mouth. As in the caſe of the Miniſtry, ſo God deales in this caſe, <hi>Eze.</hi> 3.26. <hi>J will make thy tongue cleave to the roofe of thy mouth, that thou ſhalt be dumb, &amp; ſhalt not be to them a reproofe, for they are a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe.</hi> Deafe hearts make Miniſters dumbe, and rather then diſobedient people ſhall have the Miniſtry of the Word, God himſelfe will ſilence his Miniſters, as in <hi>Jeremies</hi> caſe, God did
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:150587:76"/> not onely forbid him to <hi>pray</hi> for that people, but he forbad him to <hi>preach</hi> to that people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.5. Juſt ſo will God deale in this caſe; When hee ſends his Spirit to direct us, reprove us, and he comes and woes us, allures us, urges us to this and that duty, and we ſlight his motions, diſ-regard and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them. God when he ſees us <hi>deaf,</hi> he will make his Spirit <hi>dumb,</hi> and hee will ſtop his Spirits <hi>mouth</hi> when wee ſtop our <hi>eares.</hi> Hee ſhall no longer <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct</hi> us, <hi>direct</hi> us, <hi>reprove</hi> us, but hee will <hi>ſuſpend</hi> and <hi>ſilence</hi> his Spirit from doing theſe offices.</p>
                  <p>It ſuites juſt with that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, My Spirit hath <hi>ſtriven</hi> with them for a long time, hath <hi>ſtriven</hi> in the motions thereof to bring them to repentance, but he <hi>ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtrive</hi> with them, there ſhall come a time that he ſhall <hi>ſtrive</hi> no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So then, God would have his Spirit at laſt to forbeare ſtriving. And what was the cauſe of it? That wee ſhall ſee by that place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150587:76"/> The Spirit of Chriſt went along then with the Miniſtry of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it by his ſollicitations. How were his ſollicitations entertained? They were <hi>diſobedient.</hi> They liſtened not to the gracious motions of the Spirit, and ſo they <hi>quenched the Spirit.</hi> And how did they quench it? <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive.</hi> They ſo quenched it that it ſhould not onely ceaſe ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but it ſhould ceaſe for ever, hee ſhould never ſtrive more with them, but give them up for ever; goe your wayes, doe as you will, yee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a good motion from my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more.</p>
                  <p>See how Chriſt ſpeakes to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.33.34. <hi>Yet a little while J am with you, and then I goe unto him that ſent me.</hi> And what then? <hi>Yee ſhall ſeeke me, and ſhall not finde mee.</hi> Chriſt was with them <hi>a little while,</hi> ſtriving with them to doe them good: But they rejected the counſell of God, and would none of him: Well, ſayes Chriſt, <hi>I am a little while with you, and then I goe, &amp;c. and then ye ſhall ſeek, &amp;c.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:150587:77"/> yee ſhall not finde me</hi> though ye would never ſo faine, though ye would give all the world for it: So I may ſay of Gods Spirit, <hi>yet a little while</hi> he is with thee, <hi>yet a little while</hi> hee is ſtriving with thy conſcience, and urging thee ſeriouſly to labour for grace, <hi>yet a little while</hi> he is with thee <hi>knocking</hi> and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>at the doore</hi> of thine heart, <hi>yet a little while</hi> he is with thee to woe thee, to allure thee, to worke on thee in the Word, and the reſt of the ordinances. But if thou quench him in theſe his gracious dealings with thee, hee will <hi>goe unto him that ſent him:</hi> And then thou ſhalt <hi>ſeeke him,</hi> oh that I had but one of thoſe gracious motions I was wont to have! that I might but once more, once more heare the voyce of Gods Spirit! thus ſhalt thou <hi>ſeeke him,</hi> but <hi>ſhalt not finde</hi> him for ever, a world (if thou couldſt give it) ſhall not purchaſe one whiſper more, not a ſyllable more, from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> ſo unkindly <hi>quenched.</hi> Conſider now how dangerous ſuch a caſe will bee, and as thou wouldeſt feare it ſhould be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150587:77"/> thy caſe: ſo feare to <hi>quench the Spirit.</hi> It is a great mercy of God to give us his Spirit in this kinde to have theſe <hi>Eagles wings fluttering</hi> over us, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.19, 20. Why then for God to call home his Spirit, and to forbid him to ſtrive with us, to call upon us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, how heavie a judgement is it! It is a judgement to have a good Miniſter ſilenc'd; what is it then to have the Spirit of God ſilenc'd! It is a ſad thing to have Miniſters mouthes ſtopped; what is it then to have the Spirits mouth ſtopt! <hi>Quenching the Spirit,</hi> will prove <hi>ſilencing the Spirit; Quenching the Spirit,</hi> will prove the <hi>ſtopping</hi> of his <hi>mouth.</hi> So much for the danger of quenching the Spirit in the motions</p>

Therefore Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may know that God <hi>heares</hi> them, and <hi>accepts</hi> their ſervices. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 6. begins it with a ſad complaint, but yet ſee how on a ſudden his heart cheeres, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. and that upon this, that he knew God heard and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his prayers.

                  </p>
                  <p>When a man in prayer <hi>feeles</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> mightily <hi>inlarged,</hi> when hee <hi>feels</hi> his <hi>heart ſet on fire</hi> with <hi>fervency</hi> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>affections,</hi> this is the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> And this <hi>fire,</hi> this <hi>fervency</hi> and <hi>heate</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> with which the <hi>heart burnes</hi> in prayer, is <hi>fire that comes downe from

And when it is thus with a man, how comfortable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it is? Thus <hi>David knew that God heard him, Pſal.</hi> 6.8, 9. Fire came downe from Heaven, and burnt his Sacrifice, and by that inward fire in his heart, he as well knew that God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his prayer, as <hi>Abel</hi> by that viſible fire, knew that God accepted his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Surely, when a man feeles this fire burning in his heart in prayer, well may it be ſaid unto him, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. But now on the other ſide, when a man ſhall pray, and ſhall have no aſſurance that God accepts his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, alas what a comfortleſſe ſervice is that? from ſuch prayers may a man riſe with a ſad Spirit. Goe and eate thy bread with ſorrow, and drinke thy wine with a ſad heart, for God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts not thy prayer, God anſwers not with fire. Now what is it that brings a man into this condition? This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a ſad fruit of <hi>quenching</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Grace:</hi> Becauſe men <hi>quench

Marke that paſſage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. <hi>But the ſpirit of the Lord departed from Saul.</hi> There was the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the Lord <hi>quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</hi> And what was the iſſue? Was that all? No, marke the danger that followed upon it, <hi>And an evill ſpirit from the Lord troubled him.</hi> Gods Spirit <hi>goes,</hi> and the Divels ſpirit <hi>comes:</hi> Yea, hee came ſo that <hi>Saul</hi> was carryed into horrible and fearefull ſinnes: Hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unreaſonably malignant and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious againſt <hi>David.</hi> Hee commits a moſt barbarous and cruell murder, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 22.16. <hi>Thou ſhalt dye Ahimelech, thou and all thy Fathers houſe.</hi> It was a bloudy act to put <hi>Ahimelech</hi> to death after ſo juſt an anſwer made by him. But ſuppoſe <hi>Ahimelech</hi> were guilty, yet what had his fathers houſe done? Suppoſe <hi>Ahimelech</hi> were guilty, yet what had all the reſt of the Prieſts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150587:83"/> done? why muſt the throates of 85. Prieſts be cut, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. why muſt <hi>Nob,</hi> a Citie of the Prieſts, both men and women, children and ſucklings, Oxen, Aſſes, and Sheepe, why muſt all theſe be ſo bloodily butchered? what a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and barbarous madneſſe is this? All this ſhewed that now the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was <hi>quenched,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi> was <hi>entred</hi> and <hi>kindled:</hi> For Gods Spirit being <hi>quenched,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Divell</hi> is ſo <hi>kindled,</hi> that it carries him to <hi>monſtrous, foule,</hi> and <hi>horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> without all meaſure. Now the Spirit of God was <hi>quenched</hi> in <hi>Saul,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Divell</hi> is not only <hi>kindled,</hi> but ſo <hi>kindled</hi> that he growes <hi>outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in his <hi>wickedneſſe.</hi> And againe, after this hee goes to conſult with a Witch, hee goes and ſeeks to the Divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. When men once play the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtataes</hi> and <hi>quench Gods Spirit,</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Divell not onely <hi>enters,</hi> but <hi>enters</hi> with a witneſſe, ſo as hee <hi>hurries</hi> them as his ſlaves into all exceſſe of wickedneſſe. They doe not ſinne the common ſinnes of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.3.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:150587:84"/> 
                     <hi>Every one of them is gone backe, they are become altogether filthy.</hi> They not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>cold, careleſſe</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> but become altogether <hi>filthy; filthy</hi> ſwearers, <hi>filthy</hi> adulterers, <hi>filthy</hi> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, <hi>notorious, malignant</hi> perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>godlineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is with ſuch perſons as in that caſe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.18, 19, 20. If a man had a <hi>bile,</hi> and that was <hi>healed,</hi> and after the healing it brake out againe, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the plague of leproſie; It proved <hi>worſe,</hi> a more <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>loathſome</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe than before. A leproſie was a thouſand times worſe than before. Men that <hi>quench Gods ſpirit,</hi> kindle the <hi>Divels ſpirit</hi> in them, and ſo kindle the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Divell</hi> in them, that they who before were but <hi>bily</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they after the <hi>quenching</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> prove <hi>leprous</hi> perſons, <hi>ſtinking</hi> and <hi>filthy, loathſome lepers, they become altogether filthy.</hi> See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.22. they not onely turne ſwine, but <hi>filthy ſwine, ſwine wallowing in the myre,</hi> not <hi>beſprinkled</hi> with myre, not onely <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> into the myre, but <hi>ſwine wallowing</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:150587:84"/> and <hi>tumbling</hi> in the myre: For when men <hi>quench the ſpirit,</hi> and fall off by <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> not onely the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Satan comes in, but there is a further matter. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 45. where obſerve theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, that in a caſe of Apoſtacy the <hi>ſpirit</hi> being <hi>quencht,</hi> the Divell doth not enter ſingle, <hi>but he takes ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelfe.</hi> Chriſt caſt ſeven Divels out of <hi>Mary Magdalen, Mar,</hi> 16.9. theſe have ſeven Divels enter with the former old Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and they be worſe Divels than himſelfe. To teach, that when men <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> by falling away, the Divell not onely comes againe, but he comes ſo, that hee makes them ſeven times worſe than ever they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, thoſe 7. <hi>Divels</hi> not only <hi>enter,</hi> but <hi>dwell</hi> there, not onely <hi>lodge</hi> there for a night and away, but they <hi>dwell</hi> there. It notes, that upon the <hi>departure</hi> and <hi>quenching</hi> of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Divell is not onely preſent in their hearts, but hath his abode and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:150587:85"/> reſidence there, as in that caſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.11. Where a man dwels, there is his ſetled abode and reſidence. And that's not all, but that hee alſo was there as a Lord and Maſter, as <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1.22. So that it teaches, that when the Spirit is quenched, not onely the ſpirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan comes in his roome, but he comes powerfully and efficaciouſly to reigne in their hearts, and ſo to make them baſer vaſſals to himſelfe than ever they were before; ſo that their latter end ſhall be worſe than their beginning, not onely in regard of their miſery, but of their guilt and pollution. This is the dreadfull danger of <hi>quenching</hi> Gods <hi>ſpirit:</hi> It makes way for the re-entry of Satans ſpirit, yea for ſeven ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits worſe than himſelfe. As therefore wee dread ſuch a condition, and ſuch a danger, ſo let us beware of ſuch a ſinne as <hi>quenching the ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">A third danger of quenching the Spirit, wee may doe it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and totally.</note>3. Thirdly, a third danger is, that a man <hi>quenching the ſpirit</hi> in the graces of it, may quench it finally and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the <hi>quenching</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may prove totall and finall. Indeed the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:150587:85"/> ſanctifying <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God wee ſaw before, cannot be ſo <hi>quenched;</hi> but yet the <hi>flame</hi> of that <hi>fire</hi> may bee ſo <hi>quenched,</hi> that a man may ſit a <hi>cold</hi> a long while after, and ſuch a <hi>fire kindled</hi> in his conſcience withall, as may make him rue his folly that doth it: Yea, the <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>opperations</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> ſo <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> as not eaſily brought to <hi>life</hi> againe, and the <hi>degrees</hi> and <hi>meaſures</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> ſo <hi>quenched,</hi> as poſſibly never recovered againe, though the <hi>habits</hi> remaine. And that's ſuch a danger as may make any wiſe man take heed of <hi>quenching the ſpirit</hi> ſo.</p>
                  <p>But now for common <hi>graces,</hi> they may be ſo <hi>quenched,</hi> as <hi>quenched</hi> total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and finally. Totally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.3. <hi>They are gone backward, they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther become filthy.</hi> Altogether, they are altogether <hi>quencht,</hi> not a <hi>ſpark</hi> of good or grace left in them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Take from him his pound,</hi> not part of his pound, not halfe of his pound, but <hi>take the</hi> whole <hi>pound from him, Luk.</hi> 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Finally, like the fire that came from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150587:86"/> Heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. after it was <hi>quencht</hi> at the deſtruction of the Temple, it was finally <hi>quencht,</hi> it was never <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled</hi> more. For as for that ſtory about that fire, 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. it is but an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall fable. They have made ſhip-wrack of faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. When a Shippe wrackes at Sea, the goods are utterly loſt, without all recovery. Goods caſt away at Sea, are loſt for ever. As he of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. ſo here it is a queſtion, and it proves too ſure that ſuch live not after they are fallen: Becauſe they fall as <hi>Eli</hi> fell, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. hee fell backward, and his necke brake, and hee dyed. When men fall backward, they breake their neckes and dye, they fall fatally and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the <hi>quenching of the Spirit</hi> makes dangerous way to the dreadfull and unpardonable ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt. Woe to that ſoule that commits that ſinne, that man is paſt the helpe of prayer. His damnation is irreverſibly ſealed up. There bee diverſe ſinnes againſt the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150587:86"/> Spirit of God. 1. There is <hi>quenching the ſpirit,</hi> as here 2. There is <hi>grieving</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit, Eph.</hi> 4 30. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 3. There is <hi>reſiſting</hi> the <hi>ſpirit, Act.</hi> 7.51. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 4. There is a <hi>vexing</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit, Iſa.</hi> 63.10. 5. A <hi>doing deſpight</hi> to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. And this laſt is that which wee call the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. And marke that the firſt ſtep to this ſinne, is the <hi>quenching of the ſpirit.</hi> Here that ſinne begins. Though every one that <hi>quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the ſpirit</hi> ſinnes not againſt the Holy Ghoſt, yet every one that ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt begins his ſin at <hi>quenching the ſpirit.</hi> Theſe five bee the five ſtayres downe to Hell and to damnation unqueſtionable. And this ſinne of the <hi>quenching the ſpirit,</hi> is the firſt ſtayre of the fire. A danger able to make our hearts tremble. Is it not dangerous to ſtep one ſtayre downe towards Hell? If thou wilt adventure to goe downe one ſtep, what canſt thou tell but thou mayſt goe downe the ſecond, the third, &amp;c. If thou wilt adventure to <hi>quench the ſpirit,</hi> thou
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150587:87"/> mayſt come to the ſinne of <hi>grieving the ſpirit,</hi> and when thou haſt <hi>urged</hi> it, thou mayſt come to <hi>deſpight the ſpirit of grace.</hi> And when thou art there, where art thou then? As ſurely <hi>damn'd,</hi> as irrecoverably gone, as if thou wert in <hi>Hell</hi> already. Would we then avoid the danger of that ſinne of <hi>deſpighting?</hi> why then, take heede of vexing; if not <hi>vex,</hi> take heed of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting;</hi> if not <hi>reſiſt,</hi> take heede of <hi>grieving;</hi> if of <hi>grieving,</hi> take heede of <hi>quenching:</hi> Hee that keepes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from <hi>quenching,</hi> ſhall never come to a <hi>deſpighting</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> But if thou wilt be too bold to <hi>meddle</hi> with the <hi>firſt,</hi> take heed that thou <hi>come</hi> not to the <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly, the <hi>quenching</hi> of Gods <hi>ſpirit</hi> and the <hi>fire</hi> of it, will prove the <hi>kindling</hi> of the <hi>fire</hi> of GODS <hi>wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, it may <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> to bring <hi>temporall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> As when a Nation and a Church ſhall <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſhall forſake the <hi>truth</hi> of God, and the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150587:87"/> 
                     <hi>zealous profeſſion</hi> of his Name, ſuch a <hi>quenching</hi> will <hi>kindle</hi> a <hi>fire</hi> that will not be <hi>quenched.</hi> See 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have forſaken mee, and have burnt incenſe unto other gods, that they might provoke mee to anger with all the workes of their hands: therefore my wrath ſhall bee kindled againſt this place, and ſhall not bee quenched.</hi> Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> you may <hi>quench;</hi> but yee cannot ſo eaſily <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of his <hi>wrath,</hi> that will conſume a Nation with <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall judgements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, it may <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> to bring <hi>ſpirituall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the removall of his <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> of his <hi>Ministers. Epheſus quenched the ſpirit, Apoc.</hi> 2.4. <hi>I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi> Thou haſt <hi>quenched the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> in that thou haſt not that <hi>zeale</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> in the <hi>profeſsion</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> Well, what followes? <hi>Leſt I come and remove thy Candle-ſticke, verſ.</hi> 5. As if hee ſhould ſay, Becauſe thou haſt <hi>quenched the ſpirit,</hi> therefore I
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:150587:88"/> will <hi>quench the Candle,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hezekiah</hi> complaines, that the <hi>Lampes</hi> of the Temple were <hi>quencht,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. God doth it often, hee cauſes the <hi>Lampes</hi> and <hi>lights</hi> of the Temple to be <hi>quencht,</hi> and people they complaine of it, and finde fault with it. But let them conſider whilſt they complaine of others, whether they have not moſt cauſe to complaine of themſelves. Have not they <hi>quencht the ſpirit?</hi> have not they <hi>quencht</hi> their <hi>love</hi> to, and <hi>zeale</hi> for the <hi>truth?</hi> therefore it is juſt with God, to <hi>quench light,</hi> as you <hi>quench heate.</hi> You put out the <hi>Lampe</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> therefore God puts out the <hi>Lampes</hi> of the Temple. As you feare this, ſo look that you keep the <hi>ſpirit burning,</hi> and you ſhall keepe the <hi>Lampes burning:</hi> But <hi>quench the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and looke for it, and bee ſure of it, God will <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>Candles,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Candle-ſticke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it may and will <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> in <hi>eternall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Did yee never reade of a <hi>fire
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:150587:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> that ſhall never be quencht,</hi> that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>quencht?</hi> If not, ſee <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.43.46.48. <hi>into the fire that ſhall never be quencht.</hi> Now then if ye will make no conſcience of <hi>quenching the Spirit;</hi> yet remember there is a fire that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quencht. And that the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fire of the Spirit puts you in danger of bringing you into the fire of Hell that ſhall never be quencht. If you can quench the fire of Hell, then quench the ſpirit, and feare not. But if when you have quencht the fire of the Spirit you cannot quench the fire of Hell; then as you feare the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire of Hell, ſo feare the Quenching of the Spirit.</p>

So when a mans conſcience is in trouble, and diſquiet, a man may uſe playſters of eaſe, may ſeeke to quiet his ſpirit with merry company, good fellowſhip, following his pleaſures, following his buſineſſe, hee may be padling with theſe play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and poulteyſes that men in the world ſeeke eaſe by; but yet ſo long as the thorne is in the heart, ſo long as <hi>guilt</hi> is in the <hi>conſcience,</hi> all theſe ſlab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berments will never eaſe the paine.

Pardon of ſinne pluckes out the thorne, and ſo gives eaſe. Marke <hi>Davids</hi> phraſe, <hi>Take away the iniquity of thy ſervant,</hi> and ſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all iniquity.</hi> Pardon of ſinne is the taking of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the taking of <hi>guilt</hi> out of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> And nothing can take away iniquity but pardon: And therefore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150587:94"/> pardon taking away iniquity, that is the onely thing, that can give a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting conſcience eaſe: Then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is at eaſe when the weapon is taken away with which conſcience ſmites. Now it is nothing but guilt, that puts a weapon into the hand of conſcience to ſmite withall. When the weapon is taken away, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot ſmite; and when the conſcience cannot ſmite, then a mans ſpirit is at eaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pſalme</hi> 38.3. <hi>There is not any reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin;</hi> when a man hath a grivous ach and paine in his bones, it ſo afflicts and tortures him that he can take no reſt, lay him upon never ſo ſoft a bed, yet his aking bones will not let him take any reſt. But the way to bring a man to reſt, were to take a courſe to take away that paine out of his bones: If that ach and paine were out of his bones, hee might reſt. So here, ſinne in the conſcience makes the bones full of reſtleſſe paines, <hi>There is no reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſinne.</hi> It breakes the bones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. It not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150587:95"/> dryes the bones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. and puts bones out of joynt, but it breakes the bones, and ſo no wonder that upon ſinne there is no reſt in the bones: But now if ſin were taken away, the bones would ſoone be at reſt. And therefore pardon of ſin taking away ſin, which cauſes the reſtleſneſſe of the bones, is the onely thing to procure reſt in the bones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pſalme</hi> 38.4. <hi>My ſinnes are as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie burthen, they are too heavie for mee.</hi> A man that hath an heavie &amp; weighty burthen upon his backe, can have no reſt till the burden be taken off his back, though hee may ſeeke to eaſe himſelfe by ſitting down, by leaning, yet ſo long as the weighty burden is upon his back, he can have no eaſe, ſtill hee is under the pinch, and preſſure of it. But the onely way to give his backe eaſe, is to remove the burden, and to take it off. Sinne is a heavie and a preſſing burden, that is ready to breake a mans backe. Now the only way to give a mans back eaſe, is to remove this burden, and to take it off. Now pardon of ſinne is the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150587:95"/> removing of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Remove farre from me vanitie and lies.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. <hi>So far hath he removed our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions from us.</hi> And therefore pardon being the removing of the burden, and the removing of the cauſe of the paine, it is the onely thing that gives the back eaſe. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Come unto mee all yee that are heavie loaden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> How? I will remove and take off the burdens that lye ſo heavie upon your backes. But how doth Chriſt remove the burdens? By the pardon of their ſinnes; ſo that the onely thing in the world to eaſe a burdened Conſcience, is the pardon of ſinne. Sinne wounds the conſcience. The body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded is payned, and put to ſmart. But oyle and balme powred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wounds eaſe their ſmart and throbbing. And pardoning mercy that is the balme of <hi>Gilead</hi> that gives eaſe to a wounded conſcience, that aſſwages the throbbings and ſmart which is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> all trouble and diſquiet of conſcience is from the feare and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:150587:96"/> of wrath. The clouds that are in Gods face cauſe the ſtormes that are in the conſcience. That as in that caſe hee ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.19. <hi>Thou hideſt thy face, they are troubled:</hi> So in this caſe, when God hides his face and his favour, and men ſee nothing but anger and diſpleaſure, yea it may bee ſee hell and damnation, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is troubled and diſquieted. Then a man <hi>ſuckes the gall of Aſpes, and then the Vipers tongue ſlayes him, Job</hi> 20.16. The trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ariſing therefore from the dread and apprehenſion of Gods anger and diſpleaſure, the onely thing that can eaſe the conſcience, is the hope and ſenſe of Gods favour; let but God give a man a good looke, but ſmile lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly upon him, and that favor of God eaſes the conſcience of all trouble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>The wrath of a King is as the meſſengers of death;</hi> ſo Gods wrath much more, and when meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of death come, how is a mans heart troubled and diſquieted: <hi>But a wiſe man will pacifie it.</hi> And what if it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:150587:96"/> be pacified: Then, <hi>in the light of the Kings countenance is life:</hi> So when God lifts up the light of his countenance, then there is life, and then the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is full of peace and eaſe. I but when is it that the light and Sun-ſhine of Gods face breakes out thus? That is done in the pardon of ſinne: When ſinne is pardoned then comes peace and comfort, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> That is the onely thing that can comfort the conſcience, and eaſe it, becauſe that is an infallible evidence of Gods favour. Pardon of ſinne never comes but out of love and favour. Outward mercies a man may receive from an <hi>angry God,</hi> but pardon of ſinne never comes but from <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> And therefore pardon of ſinne being the evidence of a God reconciled, ſhewing a man the light of Gods countenance, is the onely thing that can eaſe the trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſinnes are debts. And a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> man that is in his guilt, is in his debt, and ſo in danger before God. Now a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:150587:97"/> man that is deepely in debt, cannot be without much trouble of heart. It may be he may make a ſhift, and ſet a face upon it before men: I but yet the thoughts of his debts give him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſecret nip, many a cloſe pinch. He may ſet up an high ſayle, and brave it out in apparell, but yet for all this his debts vex him, and many a night hee takes but little reſt, becauſe ſtill the thoughts of his debts trouble him. Now when a man is in this trouble of heart, and diſquiet of ſpirit with his debts, there is no way for a man to have his heart eaſed, but either to get his debts <hi>paid,</hi> or to get his debts <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</hi> And if they be ſuch, as hee is never able to pay, then no way to eaſe him of his cares and feares, but to have his debts <hi>pardoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a ſinner is in debt to God, and when conſcience is troubled about theſe debts, what ever face a man may ſet upon it, yet his heart will be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably troubled about his debts; hee will live in a continuall feare of being arreſted by Gods anger, of being
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:150587:97"/> drag'd by the throat to hell: For ſuch debts they are, as a man can never pay, <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. <hi>Two debtors that had nothing to pay:</hi> So therefore there is no other way to give a mans conſcience eaſe, but by the pardon of his ſinnes, becauſe that is the pardoning of his debts: Therefore pardon of ſinne is called <hi>blotting out iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 51. It is the drawing croſſe lines over all our debts, it is the blurring out all our ſinnes in Gods debt-booke. Pardon of <hi>debts</hi> is the onely way to eaſe a diſquieted <hi>debtor,</hi> pardon of <hi>ſinne</hi> is the pardon of <hi>debts,</hi> and therefore the onely way to eaſe our conſciences.</p>
                  <p>To teach us in trouble of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and under the ſmitings of heart, what courſe to take for eaſe and peace, viz. to make out preſently as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> does for pardon of ſin, make haſt to God, and ſue for pardon, and give God and thy ſelfe no reſt, till thou haſt got thy pardon. If thine heart ſmite thee, and thy conſcience pinch thee, fall preſently to this courſe, <hi>I beſeech thee O Lord take away the iniquitie of thy
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:150587:98"/> ſervant.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes in the caſe of ſuretieſhip, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.1, 5. So doe thou, If thou haſt ſinned, and thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have ſtricken thee with the hand, doe this now my ſon, and deliver thy ſelfe from the painful and ſmarting buffetings of thy conſcience. So hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelfe, and make ſure thy friend, ſee and humble thy ſelfe by confeſſion, and by begging, and getting thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, make God thy friend, and make him thy ſure friend, and do this quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. This is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to get eaſe, this is the only way to get reſt in thy bones. It is ſtrange how men in paine of Conſcience will ſharke for eaſe, and try all concluſions, before they will take the right courſe to come, and ſue to God for eaſe by pardon. The Prodigall was in want, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. why doth hee not ſo ſoone as he is pincht goe to his Father? no, hee will try other concluſions firſt. Hee joynes to a citizen, it may bee he may finde helpe that way: Hee will keepe ſwine, it may be he <hi>may fil his belly with the huskes:</hi> But when he hath done all,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150587:98"/> that will give him no eaſe, hee muſt come to this at laſt, I will goe to my Father, I will goe beg mercy; And he never finds eaſe, till he be in his fathers Armes, in his Fathers houſe, till his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kiſſes him and cloathes him. So men in trouble of conſcience are loth to make out to Gods pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Some will try what company will doe, ſome will try what pleaſures will doe, it may bee they may drinke away their trouble, and drowne it that way; it may bee they card and dice it away; it may be they may; it may bee they may hauke and hunt it away; it may be ſuperſtitious penance, a pilgrimage, a Popes pardon will doe the deede, it may be, multitude and variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may take off the heart ſo, that it ſhal not beat leaſure to trouble them with accuſations and torments. How vaine are all theſe: This is nothing but arrand ſharking: All ſuch courſes will not doe. It is in that caſe as in that, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>When Ephraim ſaw his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Juda ſaw his wound: then went Ephraim to the Aſſyrian, and ſent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150587:99"/> to King Jareb; yet could hee not heale you, not cure you of your wound.</hi> So when men ſee their ſpirituall ſickneſſe, and feele the wounds of conſcience, the ſmart and the anguiſh of them, then go they to this ſhift, and that, to this ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king courſe, and that; they go to their merriments, companions, ſports, plaies, imployments, ſuperſtitions, and yet can they not heale them, nor cure them of their wounds; their wounds bleed ſtill, ſmart ſtill, their conſciences throb with anguiſh ſtill, and for all this, as with them there, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. Conſcience is <hi>as a Lion</hi> unto them, and <hi>roares and teares</hi> ſtill. Men muſt come to God for pardon at laſt if they wil have eaſe. And were not a man as good come at firſt, and ſave ſo much loſt labour? Had not the Prodigall as good have come to his father at firſt, as to goe the furtheſt away about?</p>
                  <p>Sin leaves a ſting in the conſcience. When a man is ſtung with an Hornet, it afflicts the place with a great deale of anguiſh. And what will a man doe in ſuch a caſe? The firſt thing hee will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150587:99"/> doe for his eaſe, is to plucke out the ſting, the Hornet hath left behinde: For if a man apply medicines for eaſe, yet if the ſting be ſtill ſticking in his fleſh, medicines are in vaine. So when the conſcience is ſtung, and throbs, and rages, the way is firſt to plucke out the ſting out of the conſcience. Nothing can take away the ſting out of the conſcience, but pardon: <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning grace</hi> onely can fetch that out; therefore when thy conſcience is ſtung, and doth paine and vex thee, let that be the firſt thing, and let is bee done ſpeedily too, to ſeeke to God for the <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>remiſsion</hi> of thy ſinne. That will take out the ſting, and when the ſting is out, there will follow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, marke what <hi>Davids</hi> ſuite <label type="milestone">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:150587:100"/> the pardon and remiſsion of his ſinnes.</hi> Our Saviour in the forme of prayer by him preſcribed, teaches us to pray but ſixe petitions; and amongſt thoſe ſixe, the fift is <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> and obſerve with what petition it is coupled, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us.</hi> Two things may be there obſerved. 1. Firſt, hee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes petition for pardon to petition for bread. 2. Secondly, hee couples and conjoynes them. In the three firſt petitions one petition is <hi>ſubjoyned</hi> to another, but not <hi>conjoyned</hi> to the other. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdome come, &amp;c.</hi> hee ſaith not, <hi>And</hi> thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, <hi>And</hi> thy will be done. But here theſe are coupled, Give us, &amp;c <hi>And</hi> forgive us. And this to teach us, that there is as great neceſſity of <hi>pardon</hi> for eternall life, as of <hi>bread</hi> for temporall. That we ſtand in as much need of a <hi>forgiving</hi> God for our ſoules as of a <hi>giving</hi> God for our bodies: So alſo that wee ſhould bee no leſſe thoughtfull and carefull for pardon of ſinne, than men are for bread: That
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:150587:100"/> wee ſhould beg as hard, and toyle as hard for the pardon of ſinne, as for bread to maintaine life.</p>
                  <p>The Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 24.2. preſcribes his people a prayer, and that hath but two petitions, and this is not onely one of them, but the firſt of them, <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give us good. Agur</hi> put up but two petitions to God, and theſe were the petitions that he meant to put up to his dying day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny them mee not before I dye,</hi> that is, two things I have beg'd, and will not leave begging to my dying day; and one of theſe two, and the firſt of theſe two things that he would beg to his dying day, was the <hi>pardon</hi> of his ſinnes, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Remove farre from me vanity and lyes:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Lord be mercifull unto mee in the pardon of my ſinnes. So that there is no thought nor care that ſhould take up a mans time and paines all his life long, as this, how to get the pardon of our ſinnes. It is the greateſt mercy that can be ſhowne us. It is true that wee live wholly upon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150587:101"/> mercy; that we have a being it is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that wee have any comfortable being it is mercy; mercy that we have food to put into our bellies; mercy that wee have clothes to put upon our backs, mercy that we are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrowes, ſadneſſe, and heavy croſſes that others lye under; <hi>all is mercy:</hi> but yet lay all together, and they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the mercy that is in <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne; that is the greateſt mercy that can be ſhewed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1. <hi>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tranſgreſsions.</hi> See then, that it is mercy that muſt blot out tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nay it is tender mercy; nay it is a multitude of tender mercies that blots out and forgives ſinne. And therefore it being ſo great a mercy, our cares ſhould be ſuitable and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to it. The greater the mercy is, the greater ſhould a mans care be to get a ſhare in that mercy.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150587:102"/> out:</hi> Nay, if it were a Swine, nay if a Dogge, hee ſhould be pul'd out, and pull'd out ſtraight way. Such care and ſuch compaſſions would wee with haſte ſhew unto theſe vile and baſe creatures. But how often doe mens ſoules fall into the pit, even into the pit of Hell and Death by their ſinnes? and yet no care nor compaſſion to pull them out, much leſſe to pull them out ſtraightway: But for any care or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is taken there, their poore ſoules may lye and rot in the pit. A miſerable thing, that a man ſhould ſhew more care and pitie to his Swine, than to his ſoule. It being therefore the maine thing a ſinner ſhould labour for, to get his ſinne <hi>taken away,</hi> be we exhorted in Gods fear to make this our maine care: Spend leſſe time and care upon the world, upon your profits and your pleaſures, ſquander not out your cares, time and paines upon theſe vanities, theſe nothings. Spend ſome time, ſpend ſome care, ſome paines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your poore ſoules, in getting their ſinnes pardoned.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:150587:102"/>
                  <p>Let <hi>Job's</hi> thoughts be ours, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20, 21. So ſay wee, Alas <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and am a guilty perſon before God, <hi>What ſhall I doe unto God?</hi> What courſe ſhall I take that my ſinne may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? Oh Lord that I had an heart to ſeeke out for my pardon! Sayes <hi>Job, And why doeſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſsions, and take away mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Hee ſpeakes as if hee had beene thoughtfull and painefull about that buſineſſe, and wonders that after all his endeavour, hee cannot get his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſealed; As if hee ſhould ſay, Lord what is the matter that I cannot get my pardon. Now, if many of us ſhould put <hi>Jobs queſtion</hi> to God, and ſay, And why doeſt thou not pardon my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and take away mine iniquity; might not God <hi>anſwer</hi> us, And why doeſt thou not ſeeke for thy pardon, and why doeſt thou not labour for the taking away of thine iniquity. Why ſhould I pardon your iniquity, that take no care for your pardon? Why ſhould I forgive your iniquitie, that ſeeke not for the forgiveneſſe of it: Let
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:150587:103"/> us therfore make it a matter of greater care and thoughtfulneſſe than ever yet wee have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martha, Martha, thou cumbreſt thy ſelfe about many things, but one thing is needfull;</hi> and thou takeſt not the care for that thou ſhouldeſt doe. So it may be ſaid of moſt men: We cumber our ſelves with thoughts for food, for ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for our ſelves, and for our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for our backes and our bellies, for wealth and for riches, and all theſe cares are but cumbers. But there is one thing neceſſary, one thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as that ye are undone, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever unleſſe you get it, <hi>viz. The pardon of your ſinne,</hi> and as if it were a trifle, a matter ſcarce worth the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after, as if it were that which hung upon every hedge, you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver minde it, nor once looke after it.</p>
                  <p>That therefore men may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened out of this groſſe ſupine neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and be ſtirred up to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſo great a matter; Conſider theſe motives following:</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:150587:103"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> our very life lyes upon it. Every ſinner in his guilt, having his ſinne unpardoned, let him be what he will, hee is no better than a dead man. That as God ſpake to <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou haſt taken.</hi> So, behold thou art but a dead man, and a dead woman for the ſinne which thou haſt committed, if thy ſinne be not pardoned. An unpardoned ſinner is but a <hi>dead man, Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.5. Wee uſe to ſay of a condemned perſon, that hee is a dead man: But now when a mans ſinne is pardoned, then hee hath his life; as when the King gives a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man his pardon, wee ſay hee gives him life. Our Juſtification is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Juſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. A maine part of our Juſtification is the pardon of ſinne: So that pardon of ſinne it is our life. <hi>I ſaid unto thee in thy blood, live, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 16.6. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Wee which were dead in ſinnes hath hee quickned,</hi> made alive. How come wee to be made alive? for <hi>by grace wee are ſaved:</hi> God of his free
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:150587:104"/> grace hath pardoned us our ſinnes, and thus are wee quickned that are dead. Now if our life lies upon our pardon, and wee be no better than ſo many dead men without it, doth it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us to looke about us, and to get our pardon? Is there any thing of that concernement that our life is? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Moſes</hi> in that caſe urges them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46, 47. <hi>And hee ſaid unto them, ſet your hearts unto all the words which I teſtifie among you this day, which yee ſhall command your children to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to doe all the words of this Law. For it is not a vaine thing for you: becauſe it is your life, and thorow this thing yee ſhall prolong your dayes in the land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee goe over Jordan to poſſeſſe it.</hi> So in this, ſet your hearts upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and make it the greateſt of all your care to get pardon of ſinne; it is not a vaine thing, nor a trifling buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is your very life. If yee get not your pardon yee dye, yee periſh, yee are undone unto eternity. When a man is condemned to dye, if he have any friends that can doe any thing with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150587:104"/> thoſe about the King, hee ſets them all on worke, and there is great medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, great and earneſt ſuing, no paines nor coſt ſpared, riding and poaſting to and againe. Now what is the reaſon of all this adoe? Becauſe the mans life lyes upon the Kings pardon, if that buſineſſe be not plyed and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the man dyes, and is ſure to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: And therefore life lying on it, no marvell hee beſtirres himſelfe, and ſets his wits and his friends on worke with all their might. It is our caſe if ſinne unpardoned, wee are but <hi>dead men,</hi> and undone men, our life lyes upon Gods <hi>mercy</hi> in our <hi>pardon:</hi> And our life lying upon it, how doth it concerne us to beſtirre our ſelves, and to give our hearts no reſt till wee have prevailed with God for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the <hi>taking away of our iniquity.</hi> Our life ſtands in our Salvation, our life ſtands in our Redemption, our life ſtands in our Reconciliation to God: And all theſe ſtand in the pardon of our ſinnes. Our Salvation ſtands in it, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.77. Where the end of <hi>John
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150587:105"/> Baptiſts</hi> going before the face of the Lord is ſaid to be, <hi>To give knowledge of ſalvation unto his people, by the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſinnes.</hi> As a man is ſaid to bee ſaved when the Kings pardon comes. Our Redemption ſtands in it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>In whom wee have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> We may talke of Chriſts blood, and redemption by him, but redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee have none, and benefit of Chriſt wee have none, till wee have the pardon of our ſinnes. Our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God ſtands in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World, not imputing their ſinnes.</hi> And therefore ſince our Salvation, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, our Reconciliation ſtands in it, our life ſtands in it: And ſince our life lyes upon it, it ought to be our greateſt care above all things to get the pardon of our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is the in let to all other mercy, and that which uſhers in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give us good.</hi> They muſt pray for good to be given. I but <hi>your
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150587:105"/> iniquities with-hold good things from you, Jer.</hi> 5.25. Therefore their firſt petition is, Take away all iniquity: So that wee can looke for no good to be <hi>given,</hi> till ſinne be <hi>forgiven:</hi> And when ſinne is forgiven, then that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that with-holds good from us, and then way is made, and the paſſage cleered for the entrance of good. And therefore when God intends any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or a ſpeciall good to a people, hee firſt makes way for it by the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their iniquity: Hee prepares a way for his bleſſings by the pardon of our ſinnes: So when God intended the mercy of peace and liberty to his Church, deliverance from the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, ſee what hee doth withall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Speake comfortably to her that her warfare is accompliſhed,</hi> all her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions ſhall have an end. I but alas, might they ſay, wee have ſo many ſinnes, and ſo great guilt upon us, that wee cannot hope to have that comfort. Therefore ſee what followes, an anſwer to that objection, <hi>That her iniquity is pardoned;</hi> As if hee ſhould
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:150587:106"/> ſay, I will take away your iniquities, and ſo make way to that mercy; your ſinnes ſhall be pardoned, and ſo ſhall be no hindrance to you. And ſo when the palſey man came to bee healed, what was it that made the way to that mercy. So ſoone as Chriſt ſees him, hee ſayes not Sonne be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thy palſey is cured, but <hi>Be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> and then when that is done, then <hi>Ariſe take up thy bed, and walke:</hi> The pardon of ſinne made way for the cure of his palſey And ſo <hi>David</hi> makes that the in-let of his bodily health, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Who forgives all thine iniquities, who heales all thy diſeaſes. Davids</hi> diſeaſes were healed, and what made way for the healing of them, <hi>who forgives all thine iniquities.</hi> Pardon of ſinne makes way for this bleſſing. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. where King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> confeſſeth it had made way for the ſame to him; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>for peace I had great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but thou haſt in love to my ſoule, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it from the pit of corruption: for thou haſt caſt all my ſinnes behinde thy
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150587:106"/> backe.</hi> Nay, for health to an whole Land, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The inhabitant of the Land ſhall not ſay, I am ſicke.</hi> The Land ſhall be free from contagious, infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, peſtilentiall, epidemicall diſeaſes. That's a great bleſſing, but what ſhall make way for ſuch a mercy? <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> And therefore when <hi>David</hi> ſets himſelfe to praiſe God for being a God that heard prayer, hee makes this the ground of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. <hi>Bleſſed be thy name that haſt heard my prayer. Oh,</hi> how could God heare thy prayer when thou hadſt many ſinnes, which <hi>covered God with a cloud, that thy prayer ſhould not paſſe thorow,</hi> as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Mine iniquities had prevailed againſt mee,</hi> and they had kept good things from mee, and brought evill things upon mee; but yet for all that <hi>God heard my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and to make way for hearing my prayer, <hi>As for our tranſgreſsions thou ſhalt purge them away,</hi> and ſo make way for hearing prayer, and doing mee good.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:150587:107"/>
                  <p>This ſhould be a ſtrong motive to us, to get our ſinnes taken away, and pardoned. Wee ſtand in need of good to be given us daily. To have the Goſpel and peace continued, it is a wonderfull great good and happineſſe, to have the land healed, and the plague removed, and ſtayed from riſing and ſpreading, it is a good wee begge of God, and faine would have it. There is a way to have it, and to have God give us this good, but men doe not, will not take the courſe to get this good. If our ſinnes were pardoned, God would give this good of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Goſpell, and peace: If our ſinnes were pardoned, God would give this good of good and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable weather; would give this good of healing the Land, and ſtaying the plague. Now then, as we would have God doe theſe things for us, ſo let us get the <hi>pardon</hi> of our ſinnes. We pray for theſe mercies, if wee would have them, let us take heed that our iniquities prevaile not againſt us: And as wee would not have our iniquities
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150587:107"/> prevaile againſt our prayers, ſo let our firſt care be to have them <hi>purged away,</hi> and <hi>pardoned.</hi> Wee may pray for ſuch mercies as wee neede, wee may pray for the ſtaying and removing of the plague till our hearts ake, and we ſhall never prevaile, ſo long as our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties prevaile againſt us: And they will prevaile againſt us to bring on the plague, and other judgements, if wee doe not get them pardoned. So long as the people of the Land have not <hi>their iniquities forgiven them,</hi> wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke for it that the inhabitants of of the Land, of the Citie, ſhould not ſay <hi>we are ſicke.</hi> But ſo long as wee get not ſinne pardoned, ſo long as that reignes untaken away, ſo long we ſhall ſay wee are ſicke, that our Townes and Cities are ſicke of the plague of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; <hi>Behold, I will bring it heatlh and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveale unto them the abundance of peace and truth. And I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity whereby they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt mee: and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150587:108"/> and whereby they have tranſgreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, Jer.</hi> 33.6.8. That's the way to get health and cure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is that which ſeaſons and ſweetens all other mercies, comforts and contentments wee enjoy, which makes all mercies ſweet, which makes all comforts ſavoury. The want of pardon imbitters all comforts, and makes a mans ſoule abhorre them all. Looke upon a man that is in diſtreſſe of conſcience, under the ſenſe of Gods anger, and in feare of condemnation; what joy and contentment takes that man in any thing hee hath, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, houſes, lands, wealth, riches, what comfort takes hee in them all? It is with a man in this caſe, as it was with that of <hi>Haman, Eſth.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. <hi>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how hee had advanced him above the Princes, and ſervants of the King. Haman ſaid moreover, Yea, Eſther the Queene did let no man come in with the King unto the banquet that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:150587:108"/> ſhee had prepared but my ſelfe, and to morrow am I invited unto her alſo with the King. Yet all this availeth mee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as I ſee Mordecai the Iew ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Kings gate.</hi> All gave him no content ſo long as <hi>Mordecai ſate at the Kings gate.</hi> So here, though a man have all theſe comforts, and be up to the chin in them all, yet will a mans conſcience that wants pardon, be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ſpeaking thus if it be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I have ſuch and ſuch comforts, yet all this availes me not, ſo long as ſinne lyes before the doore, ſo long as my ſinne lyes unpardoned. I ſtand in a ſtate of guilt and wrath, and what know I but I ſhall goe to Hell, and bee damned, and ſo long as my condition is ſuch, what am I the better for houſe, land, wife, children, what tell you me of riches, and wealth, and theſe trifles, when Gods curſe and vengeance hangs over my head, and is ready for ought I know to fall upon mine head every moment, and to arreſt me, and drag me to hell, there to be in torment for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? But then <hi>mercies</hi> are <hi>mercies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:150587:109"/> then they are ſweet indeed, when they come ſwimming to us in the ſtreame of Chriſts blood, when they come with a pardon in their hand. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſayes <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Ziba, Thine are all that pertained to Mephiboſheth;</hi> Take thou all his lands; and ſee how hee anſwers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4. <hi>I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee that I may finde favour in thy ſight, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, I had rather have the Kings favour than the Lands, what good will the Lands doe mee, unleſſe I may have the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. So in this caſe, it is the favour of God in the pardon of ſinne that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars all outward comforts. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Comfort yee my people, &amp;c. Say unto her that her warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</hi> Is that all? No, <hi>And that her iniquity is pardoned.</hi> It is a comfort to have peace, liberty, freedome from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, moleſtations and oppreſſions; I but then it is a comfort indeed, and then it is ſweet indeed, when it comes with the pardon of ſinne. When the conſcience hath peace with God, then there is comfort, great comfort in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:150587:109"/> outward peace. So when the palſey man came to Chriſt, hee came for cure, and it had beene a great mercy to have had his health and recovery from that diſeaſe. But marke, Chriſt ſayes not, Be of good comfort, thou ſhalt have thine health, that hee tells him after hee ſhall have, but <hi>be of good comfort thou ſhalt have thy pardon.</hi> To teach, that then health and recovery is a ſweet comfort, when a mans ſinne is pardoned. <hi>Give us our bread, forgive our ſins,</hi> teaching us, that there is little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in having bread without pardon; and that, that which makes bread com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and ſweet, is when it comes with pardoning mercy. A man that lyes in priſon and is a condemned man, cloath him with rich apparell, feed him with delicious fare, let him have the ſweeteſt Muſicke, yet ſo long as he is a condemned man, and lookes every houre to be fetcht out to execution, all this gives him no content: His heavy heart puts the Muſicke out of tune, takes away the relliſh of his dainty foode: But if now a pardon might
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150587:110"/> but come from the King to ſuch a man, this would make the Muſicke ſweet, the fare pleaſant indeed: Nay, though hee had nothing but bread and water, yet a pardon would ſo rejoyce him that hee would thinke his bread and water good cheere, it would turne his water into wine. This is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that crownes all other mercies, it is a crowning and the chiefe of all other. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 21. <hi>Had a crowne of pure Gold ſet upon his head.</hi> But when <hi>David</hi> comes to bleſſe God for all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Hee ſayes not, which hath ſet a crowne of pure gold upon thine head, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Who crownes thee with loving kindneſſe and tender mercies.</hi> Hee bleſſes God for crowning him with mercy, tender mercy; for ſetting, not a crowne of gold, but a crowne of mercy upon his head. But how did hee ſet it on his head, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Who forgives all thine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity. Pardoning</hi> mercy is <hi>crowning</hi> mercy, and <hi>David</hi> more joy'd in that than in his crowne. A crowne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon is but a crowne of thornes.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:150587:110"/> 
                     <hi>Davids</hi> greateſt comfort is in his crowne of loving kindneſſe and tender mercies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is that which fits for duty, for the duties of praying, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> receiving of the Sacrament. A man is never fit for any duty till his ſinnes be pardoned. So long as a man ſtands guilty before God, as hee doth till ſin be pardoned, all his duties are turned into ſinne. That's an heavie impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.7. <hi>Let his prayer become ſinne.</hi> But marke the ground of it, and how it comes about. <hi>When he ſhall be judged let him goe out guilty, and let his prayer become ſinne.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man ſtands guilty, then his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er becomes ſinne; and every man whoſe ſin is not pardoned ſtands guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The perſon being in his ſinne, hee turnes his duties into ſinne. Not only <hi>the plowing of the wicked is ſinne, Prov.</hi> 21.4. but the praying of the wicked is ſinne. Plowing is an <hi>honeſt</hi> worke, and praying is an <hi>holy</hi> worke; but ſinne unpardoned marres both plowing and praying, turnes the <hi>honeſt</hi> worke
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:150587:111"/> of plowing, and the <hi>holy</hi> worke of praying into ſinne. It is bad enough, and ſad enough, that a man ſinnes when hee ſweares, that his oathes are ſinnes, how much more ſad is it, that a man ſinnes when hee prayes, that his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſinnes. That is the ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every man who ſtands guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hath not his ſinne pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>The end of all duties is communion with God: And a man is never fit for a duty, till hee be fit to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion with God: And a man is never fit for fellowſhip and communion with God, till his ſinnes be pardoned, and ſo never fit for duty, till ſinne be pardoned. There is no fellowſhip and communion to be had with God, ſo long as there is a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene God and us. Now a mans ſinnes unpardoned, ſet God and us at a diſtance, make a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lords hand is not ſhortened, that it cannot ſave: neither is his eare heavie, that it cannot heare. But your iniquities
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150587:111"/> have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſinnes have hid his face from you that he will not heare.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, therefore ye pray and God heares you not, yee pray and yee have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with, nor anſwer from God, becauſe your ſinnns are upon you, and they being unpardoned ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and God, and they hide his face from you; In vaine doth a man ſeeke communion with God, when ſeparated from him: Sinne unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned makes the Lord a ſeparatiſt, he will not joyne with us, nor have any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us in any of our duties. Till ſinne be ſeparated from us, God will ſeparate, and then ſinne is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when it is pardoned, and when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned then fit for duty, becauſe then ſo qualified as God will have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us.</p>
                  <p>Wee are never fit for duty till wee can ſo doe duty, that wee may expect good from duty: Then fit for prayer, the Word, the Sacrament, when ſo qualified as that we may receive good from God in them, and by them: And
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:150587:112"/> that is then when wee have our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties taken away, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give good.</hi> Why pray wee but that God may give good by that ordinance? Why heare wee but that God may give good by that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? Why receive wee the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but that God may give good by that Ordinance. I but if wee will receive good by theſe, wee muſt be fit to pray, heare, receive, let us be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified aright, and God will give good. But what is that qualification? <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give good.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men doe theſe, and no good is given them, becauſe they firſt take not a courſe to have iniquity taken away: Prayer would give good, preaching would give good, and the Sacrament would give good, if wee would come fitted for theſe duties; and this is the maine thing that muſt firſt be had to fit us, the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>No duty is accepted till a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be: No mans perſon is accepted ſo long as he is in his guilt: hee is in his guilt that hath not ſinne pardoned;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:150587:112"/> but when ſinne is pardoned, then guilt is taken off; when guilt is taken off, then a mans perſon is accepted; when a mans <hi>perſon</hi> is accepted, then his <hi>duty</hi> is accepted: A man is never fit for <hi>duty</hi> till hee be ſuch an one as may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and can never be <hi>accepted</hi> till his ſinnes be <hi>pardoned.</hi> When a man comes to God in any holy duty, and comes in his guilt, in his ſinnes, Satan is preſently ready to put in a barre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to lay his ſinnes in his diſh, that God may not regard him. Lord here is a man prayes, heares, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, Lord reſpect not his ſervice, let him have no acceptance, nor anſwer from thee. I but why Satan? Lord hee is a ſwearer, a drunkard, uncleane, covetous, hee hath committed ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, and the guilt of them yet lyes upon his ſoule: And wilt thou have communion with guilty ſinners? Art not thou <hi>a God of purer eyes then to behold iniquity?</hi> And this is a ſtrong plea, and will carry meate in the mouth of it, ſo long as ſinne is unpardoned. There is no way to enervate Satans
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:150587:113"/> pleas, but by getting ſinne pardoned; that is it alone which will take off the edge of all his accuſations. Our <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> will never be of force, ſo long as his <hi>accuſations</hi> be of force: His accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be of force, and will enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the prevailing of our prayers, ſo long as ſinne is unpardoned: But when once ſinne is pardoned, then God hath to anſwer Satan with all. It is true Satan that this man that now prayes, &amp;c. hath committed ſuch ſins as thou accuſeſt him, and thoſe ſinnes of his deſerve that hee ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but yet thoſe ſinnes of his ſhall not prejudice his prayers, nor be any ſtopping to my bleſſing, for I have pardoned all thoſe ſinnes of his, they are all taken away and forgiven. Doe but conſider that place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1. <hi>There is Joſhua ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord,</hi> that is, before Chriſt; ſtanding, that is, miniſtring in, and executing his office, offering up ſacrifices and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the people. And at the very ſame time <hi>Satan is ſtanding there alſo,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150587:113"/> him,</hi> to be an adverſary to him, that is, hee was there ready to hinder and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his prayers by putting in accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him. What was the ground of his accuſations? Wherein lay their ſtrength? That appeares, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Now Ioſhua was cloathed with filthy garments.</hi> That is, he was guilty of divers ſinnes, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. opens it, <hi>And hee anſwered, and ſpake unto thoſe that ſtood before him, ſaying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he ſaid, Behold, I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee, and I will cloath thee with change of raiment.</hi> Now Chriſt is willing to accept <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and to regard him in his ſervice. I but, Lord, ſayes Satan, <hi>hee is in his filthy garments,</hi> hee is defiled with the guilt of his ſinne. Therefore that Chriſt may make way for the prevalencie of <hi>Ioſhua's</hi> prayer, ſee how hee anſwers, <hi>Take away his filthy garments. And hee ſayes unto Ioſhua, I have cauſed thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, &amp;c. Ioſhua,</hi> thy ſins are pardoned, and ſo thy prayers ſhall ſpeed, and ſhall prevaile againſt all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that whenever man comes to pray to God, and performe that duty, Satan will ſtand at his right hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him. <hi>Joſhua cannot ſtand before Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Satan will ſtand at his right hand.</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that when ſinne is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>filthy garments taken away,</hi> then a mans prayer prevailes, findes acceptance, and proves too ſtrong for Satans reſiſtances. A pardoned ſinners prayers are too ſtrong for all the devils in hell with their accuſations.</p>
                  <p>So that all this conſidered, what a motive ſhould it be to make us get our pardon. As wee would not have all our duties to be turned into ſinnes; as wee would have communion with God in them all; as wee would get
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150587:114"/> good by, and in them all; as wee would have our duties accepted, and prevalent; as wee would bee fit to pray, &amp;c. ſo get the pardon of our ſinnes. What a ſad thing is it to loſe all our endeavours, to loſe our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hearing and receiving; all is loſt, and is loſt labour, if wee come unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. Every man that is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, is unprepared; every unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red man doth but loſe his labour in all his duties and performances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it is that which exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fits a man to ſuffer, and to beare the croſſe: It is that which every one muſt reckon upon, that will be Chriſts, to take up the Croſſe. It is but a delicacy that men dreame of, to divide Chriſt and his Croſſe: A man cannot <hi>take</hi> one, but hee muſt reſolve to <hi>take up</hi> the other. Now no man can ſuffer unleſſe hee be fit for it, and well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the ſervice. It is not an eaſie thing to ſuffer, there is a great deale of patience, of courage, of reſolution and Chriſtian magnanimity of Spirit required in him that will ſuffer for

                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:150587:116"/> Chriſt and the Goſpell. A man that is fearefull, a coward will never ſuffer. Hee that will ſuffer, muſt be free from cowardiſe of ſpirit. Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo cowes a mans ſpirit as the feare of Hell and damnation. Many a man could looke death in the face, that dares not looke Hell in the face. Many a man that ſhrinkes not at <hi>dying,</hi> yet ſhrinkes at <hi>damning,</hi> that quailes the ſtouteſt courage in the world. And there is nothing that puts a man more in the feare of Hell than guilt, the want of the pardon of ſinne. And nothing that makes a man feare Death more, then when through death hee ſees Hell, when hee ſees the gates of death open into Hell; and then a man ſees Hell through death, when hee apprehends his ſinne unpardoned; and ſeeing Hell through death, hee is ſo affrighted at the ſight of Hell, that if hee can ſhift it hee will not dye, but will redeeme himſelfe from death upon any termes: Hee will doe any thing, yeeld to any thing, be of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:150587:116"/> of any faith, rather than ſuffer death for the true Religion, becauſe if hee dye, his ſinnes being unpardoned, hee knowes there is no way but Hell for him. Thus doth ſinne <hi>unpardoned</hi> unfit a man to dye for Chriſt, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned ſinner dreads the <hi>fire,</hi> becauſe it may but prepare him for <hi>a worſe</hi> fire in Hell.</p>
                  <p>But now when a mans ſinne is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his conſcience diſcharged of the guilt, his heart is quit of all feare of Hell and damnation: Hee ſees the gates of death open into Heaven, into happineſſe. And Death is not dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor terrible at all when the doore opens that way. There is nothing ſo animates a man, ſo ſills his heart with courage and reſolution, as <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne doth. That is it which alone makes a Chriſtian Souldier valorous, that takes paleneſſe out of the cheekes, whiteneſſe out of his Liver, cowardiſe out of his heart; ſuch <hi>have their feete ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace,</hi> as it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.15.</p>
                  <p>As therefore wee would doe God
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:150587:117"/> ſervice, and his Cauſe honour, as wee would be able to be good Souldiers, and reſolute couragious Champions for Chriſt and his cauſe, which is the greateſt honour in the world, ſo get that taken away that takes away all courage, <hi>Take away the iniquity of thy ſervant,</hi> for that will take away the <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>reſolution</hi> of thy ſervant, get that off which will cowe thy Spirit, the <hi>guilt</hi> of thy <hi>ſinne.</hi> Get the pardon of thy ſinne, <hi>Get thy feete ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace.</hi> If once thine heart have the peace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels working, have peace from thy pardon, it will make thee looke upon priſons, ſcourges, rackes, ſtrappadoes, gibbets, ſtakes, fires, as at ſo many flea-bitings: It will make a man have an heart like <hi>David, his heart was as the heart of a Lion.</hi>

                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> it is an excellent and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preparative for death. There is no man but muſt die, and there is nothing ſo much concernes a man, as to be fit, and prepared to dye. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to dye, and after death comes
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:150587:117"/> judgement, Heb.</hi> 9. After death comes Judgement, and as a mans death is, ſo is his judgement, <hi>As the tree falls ſo it lyes:</hi> Such as a mans <hi>death</hi> is, ſuch is his <hi>doome.</hi> If a man dye with his ſinnes pardoned, then hee is judged to life; if a man dyes without pardon, then his judgement is without mercy, hee is judged to death, and ſentenced to Hell. Inaſmuch therefore as a man is never fit to dye comfortably, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, till death ſhall make way for him into Heaven, and a man cannot looke for any entrance into Heaven till hee be pardoned his ſinne, therefore till a mans ſinne be pardoned, hee is never fit to dye. See how <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.21. <hi>Why doeſt thou not pardon my ſin, and take away mine iniquity;</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, Oh Lord be not hard to be entreated, let mee prevaile with thee for the pardon of my ſinne. But why is <hi>Iob</hi> ſo earneſt for the pardon of his ſinne? See what followes, <hi>for now ſhall I ſleep in the dust;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Now Lord I am upon the point of death, and looke for no other but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150587:118"/> to dye; and alas, how ſad will my condition be, if I ſhould dye without my pardon. Since I muſt dye, Lord fit and prepare me for a comfortable death by the pardon of my ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Then is a man fit to dye, when the time after death ſhall prove a time of refreſhing: Times of refreſhing come after the pardon of ſinne, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to the men of Iſrael, <hi>and be converted, that your ſinnes may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> And then the times after death are times of <hi>refreſhing,</hi> when the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death are times of <hi>remiſsion.</hi> Hee hath prepared himſelfe well for death, that hath taken order that the time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, ſhalbe a refreſhing time; and that order onely hee takes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death hath taken order for the pardon of his ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Then a man is fit to dye, and never till then, when the ſting of death is taken out, ſo as death can doe a man no hurt, when <hi>death</hi> ſhall not be <hi>deadly</hi> to him. There is a ſpeech, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.23.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150587:118"/> 
                     <hi>I will kill her children with death.</hi> Some men are kill'd with death, they doe not onely dye, but they are kill'd with death, Death proves deadly to them. All men <hi>dye,</hi> but all men are not <hi>killed</hi> with death. As a godly man ſaid that hee did <hi>agrotare vitaliter,</hi> ſo godly men they doe <hi>mori vitaliter:</hi> When a man can dye ſo, then hee is fit to dye.</p>
                  <p>Now whence is it that death becomes deadly? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>The ſting of death is ſinne.</hi> Sinne onely makes death deadly. That which armes death to doe hurt, is ſinne. It is as in that caſe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.10. The Locuſts there had a power to hurt men with their <hi>Scorpion-like tailes, and their ſtings in thoſe tailes, and their power was to hurt men five moneths.</hi> So death hath a power to hurt men, but that power is from men themſelves; Sinne it is that gives this power to Death to doe a man hurt.</p>
                  <p>In Death there be two things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>hand</hi> of Death, which is the power it hath over all men, it hath

Pſal.</hi> 49.15. <hi>But God will redeeme my ſoule from the power of the grave; for hee ſhall receive mee.</hi> All men muſt come into this hand of death. Now it is ſin that gives Death this hand: But yet this hand is not deadly, it but ſeparates ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and but for a time. At the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection that hand of death ſhall be cut off, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>O death I will be thy plague: O grave I will be thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>ſting</hi> of death. That is the power it hath of delivering men over to the curſe of God and eternall wrath: And it is this ſting that makes it deadly. It may ſtrike a man with the hand, as it doth all godly men, and yet not be deadly, but then deadly when it ſtrikes with a ſting, and makes way for a mans ſeparation from God for ever. And this power ſinne onely gives death. It is ſinne <hi>unpardoned</hi> and <hi>unforgiven</hi> that gives death this power
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:150587:120"/> to deliver a man over to wrath, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him in chaines to Hell. This is to be killed with Death. Now a man can never be fit to dye, but when he is willing; And never can hee bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſo long as hee ſees Death with a ſting. The onely way to fit a man for death, ſo as to be willing to dye, is to get out the ſting. The way to get out the ſting, is to get ſinne pardoned; <hi>pardoned ſinne</hi> makes death <hi>without a ſting,</hi> and then it is not terrible. A Fly makes as great an humming as a Bee, and yet wee feare not a Fly as a Bee, becauſe a Fly hath no ſting. Wee are fit to dye when wee feare not Death.</p>
                  <p>This of all other ſhould make us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſollicitous for our pardon. <hi>Death is the King of terrours,</hi> and it is a ſad thing at the time of death to have the heart full of feares, the conſcience full of horrours, to have death looke gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in our faces. Get pardon, and free from all this.</p>
                  <p>Dye thou muſt, that's once. Now if one ſhould come and tell us, you ſhall
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150587:121"/> dye in a Gaole, you ſhall dye in a ditch, wee ſhould thinke it a ſad hearing, it would ſound dolefully in our eares. I but there is a ſpeech of Chriſts to thoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21.24. that ſounds more dreadfully then the former, <hi>Yee ſhall dye in your ſinnes.</hi> It is a ſad thing to dye in a Gaole, to dye in a ditch, but this is the ſad thing indeed, yee ſhall dye in your ſinnes. In a Gaole, in a ditch a man may dye, and yet goe to Heaven, but the man that dyes in his ſinnes, a dead Dogge is better then he, <hi>It had beene good for that man that hee had never beene borne.</hi> To dye in ones ſinnes, it is to drop downe right into Hell. It is dangerous to <hi>live</hi> in ones ſinnes, becauſe a man may dye in them, but it is more dangerous to <hi>dye</hi> in them, becauſe no way but Hell with ſuch a man. Take heede what ever ye doe, and looke to it, that when you come to dye, yee doe not dye in your ſinnes. And the way not to dye in your ſinnes, is not to live in your ſins, but to get the pardon of them while yee live. This is the happineſſe of a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150587:121"/> man whoſe ſinnes are pardoned, that being once pardoned as <hi>hee will not live</hi> in them, ſo being once pardoned <hi>hee ſhall never dye</hi> in them. It is a ſweet thing to dye as <hi>Stephen</hi> did,<note place="margin">Act. 6.56.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſee Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened, &amp;c.</hi> to dye with the ſenſe of Gods love and favour. Some when they dye they ſee Hell opened, and the Devils ſtanding about their beds ready to drag them to the place of torment: It is hideous dying ſo: which of theſe two deaths would wee now chooſe? If yee would not dye the laſt, get ſinne pardoned, that yee may not dye in your ſinnes. None can at their death, with <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſee Heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that have not firſt gotten their ſins pardoned,</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible that a man ſhould have peace and comfort in his end, that dyes <hi>without ſinne taken away</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. When death once arreſts a man, then conſcience if it be awake will bring in and lay to a mans charge all his ſinnes, and Satan will be buſie to lay on loade, and to affright a man with Hell and damnation. If a debtor
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:150587:122"/> be arreſted and caſt into priſon, it is no ſooner heard of, but every creditor comes in and brings in his ſeverall actions, and loades him with executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such is the caſe of an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner at his death. So ſoone as death doth arreſt him, Satan comes in, conſcience comes in, yea and God himſelfe comes in, all come in with their actions againſt him, and what peace or comfort can there be in ſuch a condition. But if ſinne before-hand be pardoned, all this trouble is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and a man dyes in peace. It is a rule that ſuch as are about dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons live by, that when a man is dying, nothing ſhould be done that might trouble him in his departure, that there be no ſhrieking or crying out, none will offer to pull off the clothes, to plucke away his bed from under him, becauſe they will have him dye qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, wee will not have a dying man diſturbed and diſquieted. Now how much more ſhould every one have a care, that when hee comes to dye, hee may dye quietly, that hee may not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150587:122"/> heare the cryings and ſhriekings out of conſcience, nothing will diſturbe a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man as will they. If then men would goe quietly out of the world, let them get the <hi>pardon</hi> of their ſinne: If that be not pardoned, there is little hope of departing in peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Since therefore it is a thing ſo much to be looked after; how may a man get his iniquity taken away, and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two things muſt be done to get pardon.</p>

Both theſe principles, though contrary to each other, make men careleſſe in looking after pardon, and in taking paines to get <hi>iniquity ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</hi> Who will be anxious, ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, induſtrious? who will take care and paines all the dayes of his life to be getting that, hee may have when he will for five words ſpeaking? Who againe will beſtow time and paines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which hee conceives impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bee effected. No man will ſet a teame of horſe to remove a feather, becauſe when hee liſt hee can remove it with a ſlight puffe of his breath: No man alſo will ſet a teame of horſe to remove a mountain, becauſe he knowes it is an impoſſibility: So that whileſt men either conceive it ſo eaſie to bee had, or ſo impoſſible to be had, it layes a bed all cares and endeavours after pardon. Therefore on the contrary we muſt know theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it is not ſo eaſie a thing to get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as men imagine; it is an hard
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:150587:123"/> thing to get pardon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that, though it be hard, yet it is poſſible and may be had. It is hard, yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; it is poſſible, and yet hard; and hardneſſe of obtaining and poſſibility, are the two quickners of cares and endeavours, to obtaine any good thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> then wee muſt learne that it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not ſo eaſie a thing to get a pardon, but that the worke is a difficult, and an hard worke. A worke that a man muſt tug, and ſweat at, that will coſt him a great deale of care, a great deale of trouble and contention of ſpirit, a great deale of paines and diligence, before it can be brought about.</p>
                  <p>That it is not ſo eaſie a thing as men dreame of, to get the pardon of ſinne, appeares by that ſpeech of <hi>Peters</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Repent thee of this wickedneſſe, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> Hee doth not intimate an impoſſibility of getting his pardon, for then why ſhould hee preſcribe him a courſe to ſeeke it; if hee had meant it had beene impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150587:124"/> in vaine had hee adviſed him to repent; but his meaning is to ſhew him that his pardon would not eaſily be had, but that it would bean hard, a very hard thing, though a poſſible thing to be obtained; As if he ſhould ſay, I will not deny but it is poſſible, but yet if thou wilt ever have it, it will coſt thee tugging and ſweating for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon Magus</hi> indeede was naught, and therefore his pardon might ſeeme the harder to be gotten, but yet if wee looke upon good men, wee ſhall finde that they have found it hard enough to obtaine. See how <hi>David</hi> labours and wreſtles for it, <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.1, 2. <hi>Have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c. blot out. Waſh mee. Cleanſe me.</hi> This iteration, and ingemination of his ſuite, that hee thus pulls and tugs for it, implies how hard hee found it to get pardon. Leſſe labour and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit would have ſerved the turne if it would ſo eaſily have beene had.</p>
                  <p>See how difficult a work <hi>Job</hi> found it, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20, 21. <hi>I have ſinned, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:150587:124"/> what ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of men!</hi> I have done what I can to get my pardon, and I am willing to do any thing in the world, what ſhall I doe more than I have done? <hi>And why doeſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſsion, and take away mine iniquity?</hi> Hee had done what hee could, hee had confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, prayed, hee had laboured and ſtriven with all his might, and as yet hee could not get his pardon and the aſſurance of it. <hi>Job</hi> then found it not ſo eaſie a matter to get pardon, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe imagine it to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.7, 8. <hi>Agur would beg for his pardon, and labour to get that even to his dying day.</hi> It is a thing, a worke that will take up all a mans life, it will finde him buſineſſe to his dying day, to get the pardon of ſinne. It is a mans whole life time, well ſpent too, if hee ſpeed in that buſineſſe. Alas, if it were a work ſo eaſily done as many dreame, what needed <hi>Agur</hi> have ſpent ſo much time about it? why could hee not follow the world, and follow his luſts, and take his pleaſure as hee ſaw good,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:150587:125"/> and then when hee was ready to dye, when hee was at his laſt gaſpe, have fetcht his pardon from Heaven, with a Lord have mercy upon mee? why ſayes he not, One thing I would have of thee, which I will beg when I dye, when I am dying, <hi>Remove from mee all my guilt?</hi> No, <hi>Agur</hi> knew that pardon was not ſo eaſily purchaſed, hee knew it was a great worke, and an hard work and therefore would be ſure to take time enough to doe it; hee ſaw it was worke enough for his <hi>whole life;</hi> and therefore would not make it his worke <hi>at his dying day,</hi> but till his dying day. This one thing ſhewes the difficulty of the pardon of ſinne, to conſider what God doth on his part. On Gods part, for our pardon is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> not onely mercy and grace, but great and wonderfull grace and mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Mercy, tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, multitude of tender mercies, Pſal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>Ready to forgive.</hi> I but it is out of mercy that hee forgives. And what will any mercy ſerve the turne?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:150587:125"/> No, <hi>ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy.</hi> So that unto forgiveneſſe is required, not onely mercy, not any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common mercy, but plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mercy. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of the riches of Gods grace, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath hee quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and in ſinnes.</hi> But whence was it? <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. From <hi>God who is rich in mercy.</hi> Therefore to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne is required not only grace and mercy, but riches of Grace, riches of Mercy. And God in the pardon of a ſinner, layes forth the riches of his mercy, the riches of his grace. When a rich man gives a poore man an almes, hee gives him ſomewhat of his riches, but brings not out his whole riches, layes not out his treaſures upon him. <hi>Riches is an abundance of things pretious.</hi> But now God in pardoning a ſinner layes out his treaſures and riches, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>That hee might ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of his grace.</hi> Now ſome pence, ſome ſhillings are not ſo hard to be had, common mercies of food and rayment, preſervation, theſe be but
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:150587:126"/> 
                     <hi>penny</hi> mercies, <hi>ſhilling</hi> mercies, but pardon of ſinne that is <hi>riches of Grace:</hi> And it is not ſo eaſie to get riches of mercy in <hi>pardon,</hi> as it is to get the <hi>penny</hi> mercies of <hi>food</hi> and <hi>rayment.</hi> Is it thinke wee ſo eaſie a thing to get mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mercies, plenty of mercy, riches and treaſures of grace which are to be brought forth, and laid out in the pardon of ſinne?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> not onely power and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> might, but his infinite power, his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8. <hi>Deus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, &amp;, condonans eis,</hi> not onely is hee a mercifull God forgiving, but hee is a ſtrong God in forgiving, not onely his <hi>infinite mercy,</hi> but his <hi>infinite power</hi> is required, and hath a concurrence in the pardon of ſinne. And therefore ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5.8. <hi>No God like him, no works like his;</hi> as being of God, of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power as to pardon ſinne. And therefore hence that ſame <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the remnant of his heritage? hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not his anger for ever, becauſe hee
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:150587:126"/> delighteth in mercy.</hi> So that to pardon ſinne is as great a worke as to ſhake heaven and earth, yea as to make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth. Is it an eaſie thing to ſhake heaven and earth? It cannot be done but by an Almighty power; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be done but by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power: Therefore it is not an eaſie worke; and therfore by the ſame reaſon no eaſie worke to have ſinne pardoned, becauſe an Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is required thereto.</p>
                  <p>So then, wee ſee that it is no ſuch eaſie thing to get pardon. Now theſe things are not ſpoken to diſcourage and diſhearten men from ſeeking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but to quicken and awaken men to take paines for it. Slothfull and lazie endeavours will never get things that be hard and difficult. The harder things are to be gotten, the harder muſt men labour to get them. There is no diſcouragement in the difficulty of obtaining pardon, becauſe though it be hard, yet,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is poſſible, and the worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> feaſable. All the paines in the world
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150587:127"/> will not effect impoſſibilities. But though things be hard and difficult, yet ſo long as poſſible, there is roome for, and encouragement to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. There is therefore a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of pardon. <hi>David</hi> that ſo ſtruggles for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1, 2. Hee elſe-where bleſſes God for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2, 3. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> And ſo that iniquity for which hee had beg'd pardon ſo hard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. was then forgiven: So that the work was done hardly, but yet it was done. Pardon came hardly, but yet it came. There was a time when <hi>David roared was diſquieted in his ſpirit, and hee could have no quiet, Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4. But yet there came a time when <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>Thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne, verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Hezekiah chatters like a Crane, or Swallow, mournes as a Dove, his eyes faile with looking upward, Iſa.</hi> 38.14. But <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou haſt caſt all my ſinnes behinde thy backe. David</hi> here <hi>prayes that God would take away his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:150587:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> It is idle to pray for impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, if it had beene an impoſſible thing, it had beene weakely done of <hi>David</hi> to have prayed for that which could not have been. Prayer is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon promiſes, all things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are things poſſible. So then, though it be an hard thing, yet being poſſible, it being a poſſible thing, yet an hard thing, Let it make us ſhake off both all ſlothfulneſſe out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>eaſineſſe,</hi> and all deſpondencie of ſpirit out of a conceit of the <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi> of obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> theſe falſe principles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſet upon the meanes by which it may be had. And they are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Faith in the blood of Chriſt. There is no pardon to be had without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> blood. It was the Doctrine of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Sacrifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Almoſt all things are by Law purged with blood, and without ſhedding of blood is no remiſsion.</hi> And it is not any blood that will ſerve the turne, not the blood of Bulls and Goates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <hi>It is not poſsible
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:150587:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the blood of buls and goats ſhould take away ſinnes. David</hi> then might under the Law haue ſoone had his iniquitie taken away: nor yet the blood of men. God neuer appointed men to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed as the Heathens did, and as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Iſraelites did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37, 38. becauſe as impoſsible for mans blood, as goates blood to take away ſin but it muſt bee the <hi>blood of God. Act.</hi> 20. that is the blood of the Lord Chriſt who is God. Remiſsion of ſin is to be had alone by the blood of Chriſt. It is <hi>his blood that waſhes from ſinne, Apoc.</hi> 1.5. yea it is <hi>his blood that waſhes white, Apoc.</hi> 7.14. God promiſes <hi>to give a white ſtone to him that overcomes, Apoc.</hi> 2.17. to give the pardon of ſinne. A man muſt be waſhed in Chriſts blood, and waſhed white in that before hee can have that white ſtone given him. It is then Chriſts blood that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity.</p>
                  <p>But now this blood takes not away unleſſe this blood be applyed. It wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes white, but yet there muſt be <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing</hi> before there can be <hi>whiteneſſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:150587:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeakes not onely of blood, but of the <hi>ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. It is not enough that there be the blood of Chriſt, and that hee hath ſhed it, but there muſt be beſides the ſhedding of it, the ſprinkling of it. Chriſts blood was ſhed upon the Croſſe, and yet all mens ſinnes are not pardoned; and what is the reaſon? Becauſe though his blood were ſhed on the Croſſe, yet that blood is not ſprinkled upon their hearts and conſciences: And pardon muſt be had, not onely from blood ſhed, but from blood ſprinkled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Purge mee with hyſope;</hi> it was the blood that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but yet it was the hyſope that ſprinkled the blood: It muſt be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled blood that muſt be purging blood: So it muſt be Chriſts blood ſprinkled upon the conſcience that muſt <hi>take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity.</hi> Well, but how comes Chriſts blood to be ſprinkled upon the conſcience? It is true that Chriſt ſprinkles his blood upon a ſinner, <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle cleane water upon
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:150587:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> you, and yee ſhall be cleane;</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. <hi>So ſhall hee ſprinkle many Nations:</hi> but yet it is as true, that a ſinner muſt beſprinkle himſelfe alſo. Wee muſt not ſhuffle off all to Chriſt, and ſay, It is hee that muſt ſprinkle us with his blood, and if hee will but ſprinkle me, then my ſinne ſhall be pardoned. But if wee will have our iniquity taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, wee muſt beſprinkle our ſelves. Lay theſe two Texts together, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Hee hath waſhed us from our ſinnes in his own blood. Apoc.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lambe.</hi> So that not onely Chriſt waſhes, but they alſo themſelves waſh with Chriſts blood: And therefore it is that men are called upon to waſh themſelves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Waſh you, make you cleane.</hi> It is cleere therefore that ſome way men muſt have an hand in waſhing and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves with Chriſts blood, if they will have pardon.</p>
                  <p>But now, how may a man waſh and beſprinkle himſelfe? That is done by faith and by beleeving in Chriſt.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:150587:129"/> Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>through faith in his blood.</hi> Faith is the hand of the ſoule, and the ſoule by faith puts her hand into Chriſts blood, puts her hand into the wounds of Chriſt, takes there of his blood, and beſprinkles her ſelfe, and waſhes, and wrinces off her guilt and defilement. Faith taking Chriſts blood, and beſprinkling the ſoule with it, applying it unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thereby is iniquity taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Chriſts blood is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine opened for ſinne, viz.</hi> to take away ſinne and iniquity. God opens that Fountaine, and there is an healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in that Bath to purge and cure the ſoule from guilt. But now though there be an healing vertue in the Bath, yet a man cannot be healed unleſſe hee will goe into the Bath. <hi>When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel moved in the waters at the poole of Betheſda, there was ſome healed,</hi> but not <hi>every one that was diſeaſed,</hi> but <hi>hee that firſt ſtept in.</hi> Men might have lyen long enough in the porches of <hi>Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> looking on the water and motion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150587:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſtill have beene as leprous and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as before, but hee that would be healed muſt ſtep in, muſt plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the poole. So Chriſts blood that fountaine is opened to take away ſinne, but it is not lying by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor looking onely upon the fountaine, but it is ſtepping into the fountaine, and wrincing, and waſhing in that fountaine that takes away ſinne. Now faith is that by which a man goes into that fountaine, by which hee waſhes and wrinces himſelfe in that fountaine, by which hee plunges and douzes himſelfe in the poole, and ſo gets off his guilt.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that in Scripture we are ſaid to have pardon by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>Through this man is preached unto you,</hi> and ſo offered unto you, <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> I, it is offered to us in him, but how ſhall we come by it? <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. <hi>And by him all that beleeve are juſtified from all things, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 9.2. <hi>hee ſeeing their faith, viz.</hi> The palſey mans as well as the other, <hi>ſaid unto the ſicke of the palſey, Sonne be of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:150587:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> good comfort thy ſinnes are forgiven thee. Luc.</hi> 7.48, 49, 50. <hi>And hee ſaid unto her, thy ſinnes are forgiven. And they that ſate at meate with him, began to ſay within themſelves, Who is this that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth ſinnes alſo? And hee ſaid to the Woman, Thy faith hath ſaved thee, goe in peace.</hi> There is then the way to get iniquity taken away. Faith layes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleevers ſinnes upon Chriſt, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcape goate, and he as the ſcape goate beares and carries them away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a land of ſeparation. Thus then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is had by blood, by the blood of Chriſt, by his blood ſhed, by his blood ſprinkled upon us, by faith in his blood, by faith ſprinkling and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing us with the blood, by faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his blood and merit to our ſelves. So then, if wee would get ſin <hi>taken away,</hi> wee muſt get <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſts blood, and ſtrive, and wreſtle hard to beleeve. It is a very hard thing to beleeve in Chriſts blood. A great many thinke it eaſie to beleeve in Chriſt, and the truth is, that it is eaſie to beleeve as they doe, they come ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:150587:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> by their faith that it may well be queſtioned whether they come ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly by it or not. As therefore wee ever deſire to have our ſinnes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo never give wee our ſoules reſt till wee have gotten true faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. So long as you live and goe on in your unbeleefe, it is impoſſible to have the pardon of ſinne. <hi>Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not the wrath of God abideth on him, Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> There is no pardon ſo long as under wrath. So long as <hi>in unbeleefe,</hi> ſo long <hi>under wrath, Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>To the unbeleeving all things are unclean, their conſciences being defiled.</hi> So long then as a man is in unbeleefe, ſo long hee is defiled, becauſe ſinne being not pardoned the guilt thereof defiles his conſcience and his perſon. How many be there that have had the pardon of ſinne preached to them, and offered to them in the Goſpel in the Name of Chriſt, and yet to this day their ſinnes are upon them, and <hi>not taken away?</hi> And what is the reaſon of it? Becauſe they are not ſprinkled with Chriſts blood. And why not? Becauſe they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:150587:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> want an hand of faith to take the blood of Chriſt which is ſhed, and to ſprinkle it upon their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And ſo for want of faith they have all their ſinnes lye unpardoned upon their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> repentance for ſin. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is no pardon to be had without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As there is a faith unto life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.47. <hi>Hee that beleeveth on mee hath life:</hi> And <hi>a juſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. So there is <hi>a repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, Act.</hi> 11.18. And as the Lord Chriſt is a Saviour, ſo hee is a <hi>Prince, Act.</hi> 5.13. And to what end is hee both? <hi>A Prince and Saviour for to give repentance to Iſrael and forgiveneſſe of ſinne.</hi> Hee indeede gives forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne, but hee alſo gives repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yea and hee gives repentance that he may give pardon: And where hee intends the latter, hee workes the former. <hi>David</hi> begs <hi>to have his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity taken away.</hi> God hee promiſes to take away another thing, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh.</hi> It is a ſure thing that they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:150587:132"/> that will have <hi>iniquity</hi> taken away, muſt have the <hi>ſtony heart</hi> taken away; they that will have the <hi>ſting</hi> taken out of their heart, muſt have the <hi>ſtone</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their heart, hee gives repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſsion of ſinnes, when he gives remiſsion hee takes away the ſting, when hee gives repentance hee takes away the ſtone; and he firſt takes away the ſtone before hee removes the ſting. And therefore Chriſt joynes both theſe together in the commiſsion hee gives his Apoſtles, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.47. <hi>And that repentance and remiſsion be preached in his Name.</hi> They that preach remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Chriſts Name, and preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in his Name, they muſt firſt preach <hi>repentance</hi> before they preach <hi>remiſsion.</hi> All to teach that they muſt have repentance that will have remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that repentance is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes to get the pardon of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And therefore wee ſhall ſee that the promiſes of pardon are made to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that when God promiſes to give pardon of ſinne to any hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:150587:132"/> it to ſuch as are ſo conditioned and ſo qualified with repentance. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. There is the promiſe of <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that ſhall be opened for ſinne,</hi> that is, to take away the ſinne of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I, but that fountaine is yet unto the Jewes a ſealed fountaine, their iniquity is not taken away, they yet lye under their guilt: But yet there is a promiſe of <hi>a day</hi> when that ſealed fountaine ſhall be broken up, and ſhall be opened. But what day is it? <hi>In that day.</hi> In what day? It hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that which goes before in the former chapter. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11. &amp;c. <hi>They ſhall looke upon me whom they have pierced,</hi> that is, they ſhall beleeve in Chriſt whom they crucified, <hi>And</hi> upon it <hi>they ſhall mourne for him, &amp;c.</hi> They ſhall repent for that ſinne of the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, and the murder of him, <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>in that day ſhall a fountaine be opened to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jeruſalem.</hi> In that day then that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall mourne, <hi>in that day</hi> ſhall the fountaine be opened
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:150587:133"/> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for ſinne. <hi>Oh that mine head,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ieremy, were as a fountaine of teares.</hi> When their heads and hearts ſhall be opened as a fountaine of teares to mourne for their ſinnes, then ſhall the fountaine of Chriſts blood be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for their ſinnes. When they ſhall waſh themſelves in the fountaine of <hi>teares of repentance,</hi> in that day will God waſh them in the fountaine of <hi>Christs blood.</hi> The day of repentance is the day of pardon, in that day a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repents, in that day God pardons, and takes away iniquity.</p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion but the Lord lives by his owne rule which he gives us to live by. The rule hee gives us to live by is that <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>If hee repent forgive him, if hee treſpaſſe againſt thee ſeven times, yet if he ſay, I repent, you ſhall forgive him.</hi> As upon a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers repentance wee muſt forgive, ſo upon our repentance God will forgive: Repent and thy brother muſt forgive, and repent, and God will forgive. Alas what are <hi>our mercies</hi> to the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God?</hi> Gods mercies are an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:150587:133"/> a boundleſſe bottomleſſe ſea of mercies, our mercies are but ſmall drops out of this Sea. Now if God do binde us that have but poore, ſmall, and a few drops to be thus mercifull, as upon repentance to forgive them, then ſurely the Lord whoſe mercies are as the waters of the Sea, that cover the earth, upon our repentance will give us pardon, or elſe our drops ſhould do more than his Sea, and hee ſhould binde us to doe more with our drops of water, then hee will doe with his whole Sea. Surely as mans power, wiſdome, juſtice, cannot exceed Gods, ſo neither can mans mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions goe beyond his. He that will have a treſpaſſer againſt man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned upon his repentance before man, hee will pardon a treſpaſſer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God upon his repentance before him.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe alſo are thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Come now, &amp;c.</hi> Now: When? <hi>Waſh you make you cleane, &amp;c.</hi> and then <hi>come, and though your ſinnes be as Scarlet, &amp;c.</hi> Scarlet is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:150587:134"/> a deepe dye, a dye that will hold, a dye that will not eaſily be fetcht out, not eaſily made white: And yet God promiſes to turne ſcarlet colour into ſnow colour, ſcarlet into white. It is eaſie to turne white into ſcarlet, but not ſo eaſie to turne ſcarlet into white. And yet God will doe it. Hee will waſh them with the ſcarlet blood of Chriſt, and that ſhall turne their ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let into white. Other blood dyes and ſtaines what is waſhed in it, but Chriſts blood takes out ſtaines, and makes white, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lambe.</hi> I, but when will God thus change their ſcarlet white, when will hee take away their iniquity? Then when they were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and made cleane, &amp;c. Upon the condition of their repentance hee would give them the pardon of their ſinnes. And upon the ſame condition is the ſame promiſe; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man his thoughts, and let him returne
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:150587:134"/> unto the Lord, and hee will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for hee will abundantly pardon;</hi> hee will multiply to pardon.</p>
                  <p>And wee finde that God upon ſuch condition hath made good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I acknowledged my ſinne unto thee: and mine iniquity have I not hid: I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions unto the Lord, and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the iniquity of my ſinne.</hi> That is, I did repent and humble my ſoule in the confeſsion of my ſinne, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne: Not that repentance fetches in pardon by way of merit, as monie buyes pardons at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor yet that repentance layes hold on pardon, which is the worke of faith alone. But for two reaſons par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don followes upon repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the faith that lookes on Chriſts blood, lookes at the ſame time on its owne ſinne, and every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſinner is at the ſame time a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinner, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourne.</hi> So that faith not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:150587:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> onely ſees Chriſt, but ſees him pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, pierced by its owne ſinne. They not onely ſee Chriſt pierced, but Chriſt who they themſelves have pierced: They ſee him, and mourne: <hi>Faith</hi> lookes upon him with a <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eye.</hi> The faith that lookes upon Chriſt is a repenting faith, and never repents and mournes more, then when it lookes moſt on Chriſt. So that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance being ſo neceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon faith, therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of remiſsion is made to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the want of aſſurance of pardon doth no leſſe diſquiet the heart then the want of pardon it ſelfe. Now ſuppoſe a man upon his faith have his pardon, yet hee cannot bee aſſured of it till hee doe repent. Upon repentance God gives the aſſurance, and ſeales it to the conſcience: And therefore upon repentance it is that pardon is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>So then, would wee have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne, would wee have iniquity taken away? See then what is to be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:150587:135"/> done. As thou wouldeſt have <hi>pardon,</hi> ſo fall cloſe to the taske of <hi>repentance:</hi> So humble thy ſelfe for thy ſinnes, mourne and be in bitterneſſe of ſpirit; judge thy ſelfe and turne from thy ſinnes, and God will then ſhew mercy to thee in thy pardon. So long as thou liveſt and lyeſt in thy ſinnes, and goeſt on in thine impenitency and hardneſſe of heart, thou canſt not have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor the hope of pardon of thy ſinne.</p>
                  <p>You have many that hope their ſins are pardoned, and that God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away their injquity; and why ſo? Why they thanke God they beleeve in Chriſt, and that with all their hearts. It is well if they doe ſo. But yet they that will have pardon muſt <hi>repent</hi> as well as <hi>beleeve:</hi> You thanke God you beleeve, but in the meane time where is your repentance. <hi>Though I had all faith ſo as I could remove mountaines, and yet have not love, I am nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. So in this caſe, though thou hadſt all faith ſo as thou couldeſt remove mountaines, yet if you want repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:150587:136"/> in this caſe thou art nothing; thou haſt not, nor canſt have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at Gods hand. Thou ſayeſt thou beleeveſt, and therefore thou hopeſt thou haſt thy pardon. I, but the faith that helpes to pardon, is a <hi>repenting</hi> and a <hi>mourning</hi> faith. Thy faith is no ſuch faith. Thou ſayeſt thou beleeveſt; I, but yet thou art a drunkard, a ſwearer, an uncleane, a covetous perſon. Thy faith is a ſwearing faith, thy faith is a drunken faith, thy faith is a whoring faith, a covetous faith. Now doeſt thou thinke that a whoring, drunken, ſwearing faith, is a faith that will help thee to the pardon of thy ſinne? No ſuch matter. <hi>In that day a fountaine ſhall be opened for ſinne, Zech.</hi> 13.1. But in what day? <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourne and be in bitterneſſe.</hi> Not ſimply in that day when they have a faith to ſee him, but in that day when they ſhall ſee him, and mourne for him; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not made to any faith, but to a mourning faith, to a repenting faith. Doe but marke that paſſage, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:150587:136"/> 
                     <hi>Then Simon himſelfe beleeved alſo, yea and was baptized, and continued, and kept company with Philip.</hi> Here was a faith that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had: But ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Repent thee of this thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. Therefore there is a faith that men may have, and yet they may be guilty of wickedneſſe, there is a faith that men may have, and yet be in the gall of bitterneſſe, yet be in the bonds of iniquity: And ſuch a faith will not ſerve for pardon, but if men will have pardon, they muſt repent of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe: The faith that muſt helpe to the pardon of ſinne, muſt be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting faith. And though thou talke of faith, whileſt thine heart akes, yet if thy faith be not a mourning, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith, thy ſinnes are not pardoned, thine iniquity is not taken away, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcomes I will give a white ſtone,</hi> that is, I will give him the pardon of his ſinne, as a white ſtone was a token of abſolution and diſcharge to a man queſtioned for his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:150587:137"/> life. So long as men live in their ſins, they are all blacke and filthy, they are Ethiopians in their blacke skins. Doe you thinke that God will give the white ſtones to ſuch as have blacke ſoules? They muſt be white that will have the white ſtone. How ſhall men become white? <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.39. <hi>They ſhall be afflicted,</hi> that they may bee brought to <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>ſo be made white.</hi> Repentance makes white, and when men are made white by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then God gives them the white ſtone, ſeales to them the pardon of their ſinnes. Therefore as ever wee deſire to get the pardon of ſinne, ſo be wee humbled, and repent for ſinne.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if pardon of ſinne bee a thing ſo much to be looked after, and of ſuch concernement, then give thy ſoule no reſt till thou haſt gotten aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of ſinne, and till thou knoweſt that thy ſinne is <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> For God doth not onely pardon ſinne, but God aſſures a ſinner of his pardon, not onely gives but ſeales a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:150587:137"/> pardon, and this is properly the white ſtone, the ſeale and token of abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pardon. What is a man the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a pardon if he know it not? A condemned Malefactor may have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but ſo long as hee knowes it not, he is in as much feare and perplexity of ſpirit, as another Malefactour that hath none: There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them in regard of <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of ſpirit. Therefore the Lord not onely pardons ſinners, but when hee pardons them, hee makes it known unto them, and aſſures their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, that ſo they may not onely have <hi>pardon,</hi> but <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> of ſpirit. Doe but conſider that Text, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Joſhua was there cloathed with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy garments, and ſtood before the Angel,</hi> before Chriſt; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Chriſt ſpeakes twice, hee ſpeakes to them that ſtood by, and to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> himſelfe. <hi>To them that ſtood by, hee ſaid, Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filthy garments from him.</hi> It is my will and pleaſure that <hi>Ioſhua's</hi> ſins be taken away and pardoned. That's happy for <hi>Ioſhua:</hi> But is that all? No,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:150587:138"/> he ſpeakes a ſecond time. <hi>And unto him he ſaid,</hi> not only unto them that ſtood by, but unto him, unto <hi>Ioſhua</hi> hee ſaid, <hi>Behold I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee.</hi> So that Chriſt doth not onely <hi>pardon</hi> a ſinner, but gives the pardoned ſinner <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it. There is not onely a ſentence of abſolution pronounced in the Court of <hi>Heaven</hi> before thoſe that ſtand before Chriſt, but a ſentence of abſolution pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Court of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Hee not onely ſayes to them that ſtood before him, <hi>Ioſhuaes</hi> ſinne is pardoned, but hee ſayes to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> himſelfe, and unto him he ſaid, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> thy ſinne is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, as to the <hi>palſey man, Be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> Therefore ſhould we not onely labour for pardon, but for the knowledge of it, for thereupon lyes our peace and comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may a man know then that his ſinne is pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides the ſecret teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and witneſſe of Gods Spirit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a mans pardon to him in the very
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:150587:138"/> acts of holy duties and Ordinances, it may be knowne by theſe things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the mortification of ſinne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and the taking away the reigning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof. There is in ſinne a double <hi>power:</hi> There is a <hi>condemning</hi> power, and there is a <hi>commanding</hi> power, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it rules and reigns in a mans heart, ſo as hee is under the obedience of it. There is the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne, and there is the <hi>dominion</hi> of ſinne, that by which it rules in the hearts and lives of men: of the firſt yee have mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> Of the ſecond, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> The guilt is the damning power, and the dominion is the reigning power. Now <hi>David</hi> here prayes, <hi>Take away the iniquity of thy ſervant;</hi> that is, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſinne. Now pardon of ſinne ſtands in the taking away of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and condemning power, and when a man knowes that the damning and condemning power of his ſinne is taken away, then hee may know that his ſinne is pardoned. But how ſhall a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:150587:139"/> man know that the damning power of ſinne is taken away? Then is the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power taken away when the reigning power is taken away: Then is the <hi>condemning</hi> power taken away when the <hi>commanding</hi> power is taken away: Then is the guilt taken away, when the dominion is taken away. Whereſoever ſinne is pardoned, it is ſinne ſubdued, it is ſinne mortified, it is ſinne forſaken, and caſt off: So that if a man know his ſinne to be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſubdued, and know himſelfe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the reigning and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power of it, hee may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it that hee is delivered from the damning power of it.</p>
                  <p>Juſtification is called <hi>the Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. As it is a Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life, ſo it may be called <hi>a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of Death.</hi> A juſtification of life to a mans <hi>perſon</hi> that is pardoned, a juſtification of death to a mans <hi>ſinne</hi> when hee is pardoned, becauſe upon the juſtification of a mans perſon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes neceſſarily the mortification of a mans luſts: And ſo pardoned ſinne
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:150587:139"/> is deaded ſinne. Sinne no ſooner loſes the <hi>Sword</hi> to kill, but it loſes the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to rule: and therefore if the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be loſt, the ſword is loſt. If the dominion be mortified, the guilt is certainely pardoned, for all dominion flowes from guilt, and it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power that enables ſin with a commanding power: So that if the commanding power be taken away, it is a ſure ſigne that the condemning power is taken away, for otherwiſe the commanding power would remaine in full force and ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>See <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſsion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy. He will turne againe, he will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion on us: he will ſubdue our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thou wilt caſt all their ſinnes into the depths of the Sea.</hi> Marke then where God pardons iniquity, and caſts ſinnes into the depths of the Sea, there hee alwayes ſubdues iniquity: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:150587:140"/> where iniquity is ſubdued, there iniquity is pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Lay together thoſe two Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He ſhall turne ungodlineſſe from Jacob,</hi> that is, hee ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and pardon the ſin of <hi>Jacob.</hi> But now <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. the words lye other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Vnto them that turne from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion in Iacob.</hi> This diverſifying of the words teaches thus much: That where ungodlineſſe is turned from men, there men are turned from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe; where mens perſons are <hi>juſtified,</hi> there mens luſts are <hi>mortified;</hi> where God gives men pardon of ſinne, there God gives power againſt ſinne: And ſo alſo where God hath given po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, there God hath given pardon; and where men are turned from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, there ungodlineſſe is turned from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you, for ye are not under the Law,</hi> and ſo under guilt, <hi>but ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace,</hi> you have your ſinnes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the grace and mercy of God. See then, that ſo long as under
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:150587:140"/> the Law, and under guilt, ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of ſinne. That when under grace and ſinne pardoned, then ſinne hath no dominion. And that therefore when men are <hi>not</hi> under the <hi>dominion,</hi> under the commanding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ſinne, that that is a ſure ſigne they are under <hi>Grace,</hi> their ſinnes are pardoned, and they are freed from the condemning power of them.</p>
                  <p>Doe but marke that Text, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.22, 23. <hi>If it ſpread much abroad in the skin, then unclean, it is a plague.</hi> To teach, that if ſinne reigne, then a man is not pardoned, hee muſt be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced uncleane. But in the next verſe. <hi>If the ſpot ſtay in his place, and ſpread not, it is a bile, and the Priest ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him cleane.</hi> Strange that a man ſhould have a ſpot, and a burning bile, and yet be pronounced cleane. Why ſo? Becauſe it ſtayes in its place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpreads not. To teach, that though men may have luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which are ſpots in the ſoule, yea burning biles, yet if they ſpread not, reigne not, they are not imputed,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:150587:141"/> they are pardoned. Therefore where the reigning, ſpreading, commanding power of ſinne is gone, there the condemning power is alſo taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>Wouldeſt thou then know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy ſinnes be taken away or no? Looke into thine heart, into thy luſts, into thy life. Are thine iniquities ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: Art thou turned from tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Art thou free from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy luſts? Luſts thou haſt, but yet they are but <hi>burning biles,</hi> they be ſpots, <hi>but they ſtay in their place,</hi> they doe not <hi>ſpread:</hi> Are thy luſts mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? be of good comfort, thy perſon is juſtified. Is the commanding power taken away? be of good comfort, the condemning power is taken away. This ſayes unto thee, as Chriſt to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> I have paſſed by thine iniquity. But by this may many ſee that their ſinnes are not pardoned. If pardoned, why under the power of habituall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? How is it that thy looſe luſts have ſuch command over thee. Thy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:150587:141"/> luſts ſubdue thee, they are not ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore not pardoned. The ſpot ſpreads much abroad in thy skin, it is not a large bile, it is a plague. Thou art undone, thou art in thy guilt, thy ſinne is unpardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.5, 6. They who are <hi>waſhed in Chriſts blood are made Kings and Prieſts.</hi> They that are pardoned, have their iniquities ſo ſubdued, that they reigne over as <hi>Kings,</hi> and ſacrifice the bed of ſinne in mortification as <hi>Prieſts.</hi> But now if ſinne and luſt be the King, and that reigne over thee, that be the King and thou be the ſlave and the drudge, then art thou not waſhed in Chriſts blood, then are not thy ſinnes pardoned. Take it for a ſure truth, that ſinne <hi>unmortified</hi> is ſinne <hi>unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Sinne in the throne is ſinne unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the ſanctification of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> mans heart and ſpirit. When God takes away iniquity, hee furniſhes that man with all ſanctifying graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>I have cauſed thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to paſſe from thee.</hi> There is the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:150587:142"/> pardon of ſinne, <hi>And J will cloath thee with change of rayment,</hi> I will furniſh thee with the graces of ſanctification. That as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9, 10, 11. <hi>Then wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed I thee with water: yea, I throughly waſhed away thy blood from thee, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed thee with oyle. I cloathed thee alſo with broidered worke, and ſhod thee with Badgers skin, and I girded thee about with fine linnen, and I covered thee with ſilke. I decked thee alſo with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and J put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chaine on thy necke.</hi> So in this caſe. So that whereſoever a man findes true ſanctifying grace in his heart, it is an evidence that his ſinnes are pardoned. The love of Chriſt, and the love of God it is a grace of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and therefore it is a ſigne of pardon of ſin. See <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto thee, Her ſinnes which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little.</hi> Where the particle, for, is not cauſall, not ſhewing the cauſe of her remiſſion, but onely a ſigne of her remiſſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. The Phariſee
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:150587:142"/> findes fault with Chriſt for ſuffering a ſinner to be ſo familiar with him. Chriſts anſwer is, ſhee is no ſinner. He proves it, becauſe her ſinnes were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her; but how proves hee that? <hi>For ſhe loved much:</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, This grace of love is an evidence that declares her ſinne is pardoned. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Who was before a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly, in unbeleife. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love, in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as love to God, ſo love to our brethren, and delight in their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſociety is made a ſigne of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>I will take away the iniquity of that Land, in one day.</hi> The iniquity of that Land, that is, the guilt of the Churches iniquities, for by the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was typified the Church or people of God; and this I will doe in one day, that is, by the alone and all-ſufficient ſacrifice of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150587:143"/> Chriſt offered up once for ever. <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, ſhall ye call every man his neighbour under the Vine, and under the Fig-tree.</hi> In that day, namely, when as the people of God ſhould by that onely ſacrifice ſo offered up to God for ſinne, through the alone juſtification of faith, come to enjoy the true ſpirituall and inward peace themſelves, then ſhould they expreſſe ſo much love and charity towards others, as to call in them who were unconverted, to come and partake of the ſame good with them.</p>
                  <p>By this try: Is thy love to God, and to Chriſt, and to his Saints? A good ſigne. But on the contray, the unholineſſe of mens hearts and lives, argues how it is with them. To have ſinne pardoned, is to be under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For yee are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Can a man bee under Grace, and have no grace? Can a man bee under Grace, and graceleſſe? Certainely, graceleſſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:150587:143"/> perſons are not under Grace, have not their ſinnes pardoned. Such have never yet aright ſought for, much leſſe obtained the taking away of their iniquity.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Prophet complaines <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. of the courſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment that he had amongſt the people; <hi>that hee was a man of contention to the whole earth,</hi> hee was counted a contentious fellow, and ſo hated and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:150587:146"/> curſed as a man <hi>contentious.</hi> That hath alwayes beene the lot of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Saints, to have that imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid upon them. A man may ſtrive in his Miniſtery to bring men to repentance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>My Spirit ſhall ſtrive no longer with man.</hi> Therefore Gods Spirit ſtrives in the Miniſtery of his ſervants whileſt hee ſets them on to make them ſtrive to bring men to God. <hi>And men may ſtrive, and contend earneſtly for the faith once given to the Saints, Iude</hi> 4. And yet this makes not men, men of contention in an ill ſenſe. Indeed the world counts ſuch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men: But who they be that truly deſerve that cenſure wee ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. <hi>But unto them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and doe not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſſe, indignation, and wrath.</hi> Therefore ſuch as doe not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the truth, but obey unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they are the contentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Well, but yet the Prophet muſt goe for a contentious man, and ſo a man odious. What's the matter? It may be hee was an uſurious oppreſſor,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:150587:146"/> and therefore contentious and curſed. Hee purges himſelfe from that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>I have neither lent on uſury, nor have men lent to mee on uſury.</hi> Therefore it muſt be ſome what elſe. Hee therefore layes downe the true cauſe why hee was ſo judged, and ſo hated: And that in theſe words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. latter end, <hi>Know that for thy ſake I have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rebuke.</hi> What ever is pretended, yet Lord this is the true cauſe. It is for thy ſake alone that I am thus odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that hee opens more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. for thy ſake it is, for <hi>thy words were found by mee, and I did eate them.</hi> I have beene faithfull when I found what thy word and will was, to diſperſe and practiſe it, and hence is all this adoe, therefore the clamours and curſes are againſt mee. Becauſe I eate thy Word, therefore it is that they are ready to eate up mee, and to devoure mee. That is the dependance of theſe words. And wee may take this by the way from it. <hi>That the true ground of all clamours, curſes, reproaches againſt Gods ſervants, is nothing elſe but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:150587:147"/> this, tbeir conſcientious and cloſe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God, and walking by the rule of his Word. Pſal.</hi> 69.7, 8, 9. <hi>For thy ſake I have borne reproach: ſhame hath covered my face. I am become a ſtranger unto my brethren, and an alient unto my mothers children. For the zeale of thine houſe hath eaten me up: and the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of them that reproached thee, are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon mee.</hi> Becauſe the word is eaten by them, or they eaten up with zeale for God and his Word, therefore is the world ready to eat them.</p>
                  <p>For the words themſelves, and their ſenſe. <hi>Thy words were found by mee,</hi> that is, thou didſt reveale and make known thy Word and will to mee. <hi>And I did eate them.</hi> It is a <hi>metaphor</hi> by which hee expreſſes with what readineſſe and forwardneſſe hee received the Word either to diſperſe it to others, or for his owne practiſe and obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſuch readineſſe and affection, as an hungry man would doe his meate, I was as willing to diſperſe, and obey thy Word, as if thou hadſt commanded mee to have eaten meat when hungry.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:150587:147"/>
                  <p>And ſo the point is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Word of God found by us,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">

                     </label> 
                     <hi>made knowne to us, must be eaten of us.</hi> It is not enough to heare the Word, to reade the Word, but wee muſt eate the Word. That which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did in a ſpeciall caſe peculiar to them, that muſt wee all doe; <hi>Eze.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Moreover, he ſaid unto me, Sonne of man, eat that thou findeſt: eate this roule, and goe, ſpeake unto the houſe of Iſrael. So I opened my mouth, and hee cauſed me to eate that roule. And he ſaid unto me, Sonne of man, cauſe thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I give thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth, as hony for ſweetneſſe.</hi> So <hi>John, Apoc.</hi> 10.9. <hi>And J went unto the Angel, and ſaid unto him, Give mee the little Booke. And hee ſaid unto mee, Take it and eate it up, and it ſhall make thy belly bitter, but it ſhall be in thy mouth as ſweet as honey.</hi> So wee, when we finde the Word muſt eate it. There muſt be a manducation, a comeſtion of the Word.</p>
                  <p>As the body hath its food, ſo the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:150587:148"/> ſoule alſo. Now for the body, it is not enough to ſee food, and looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, nor to feele food, and to handle it, nor to ſmell food, but if the body will be nouriſhed and maintained in life, it muſt eate food, and take it in; ſo likewiſe the ſoule <hi>having</hi> its food, and the Word <hi>being</hi> its food, it is not enough to heare it, and receive it in at the eare, but it muſt alſo eate it, and take it in at the mouth.</p>
                  <p>The Word is <hi>milk,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. <hi>I have fed you with milke:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not enough for men to have milke amongſt them, but they muſt be fed with it, and they muſt feed upon it. And how can men feed unleſſe they eate?</p>
                  <p>The Word is <hi>bread, Amos</hi> 8.11. <hi>A famine not of bread, but of the Word,</hi> that is, a famine not of bodily, but of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bread: Therefore it is ſprituall bread. And what more uſuall then this Scripture phraſe of eating bread. Bread is appointed, and made for that uſe and end to be eaten. Bread may be in the houſe, may be on the table,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:150587:148"/> may be in a mans hand, and yet if a man eate it not, hee is never the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor fuller, nothing can ſatisfie a mans hunger, or keep life up, but the eating of bread.</p>
                  <p>The Word is <hi>hony, Pſal.</hi> 119.103. And of this hony may it bee ſaid as <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.16. <hi>Haſt thou found Hony? eat ſo much as is ſufficient for thee:</hi> or as <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.13, 14. <hi>My ſon, eat thou hony becauſe it is good, and the hony combe, which is ſweet to thy taſte. So ſhall the knowledge of wiſdome be unto thy ſoule: when thou haſt found it, then there ſhall be a reward, and thy expectation ſhall not be cut off.</hi> As wee ſee <hi>Samſon, Judg.</hi> 14.8, 9. <hi>When he found hony in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keyſe of the Lion, he took thereof in his hands, and he went on eating.</hi> So when wee finde this hony, it is not onely to be lookt on, gazed on, wondred at, talkt of, but to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That ſhall feed you.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word is to be fed upon, and to be eaten, elſe how fed? See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. <hi>Buy and eate:</hi> what is that? <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>hearken and eat.</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:150587:149"/> word muſt be ſo hearkned unto as muſt be eaten. When God gives the Miniſtery of the Word hee makes that good. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I laid meat unto them.</hi> And when hee layes meat to us, hee lookes wee ſhould eate that meate. And that which wiſdome ſpeakes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Come and eate of my bread,</hi> may without any great forcing be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto this particular, for that bread there ſpoken of is offered in the Miniſtery of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better conceiving of this duty, conſider ſuch particulars as this metaphor implyes. Conſider wherein this <hi>eating</hi> ſtands. It ſtands in theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> in an appetite unto, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after the word. Unto eating is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an appetite and a ſtomacke, it is mens appetites and hunger that ſets them on eating: A man cares not for eating unleſſe his appetite and ſtomack be up, unleſſe hee be hungry. So this eating of the word implyes an <hi>appetite</hi> and a <hi>ſtomacke</hi> to it. When God ſets this food before us, wee ſhould have
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:150587:149"/> our ſpirituall appetite, and come to it with <hi>ſharpe ſet</hi> ſtomackes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the Word.</hi> And ſuch an appetite had <hi>Iob</hi> to the Word, <hi>Iob</hi> 23.12. <hi>I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the words of his mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi> Hee had it in ſuch eſteeme that he deſired it more, and had a ſtronger appetite to it then to his neceſſary food, not onely then he had to his dainties and ſuperfluities, but more then to his neceſſary ſubſtantiall food, without which hee could not well live and ſubſiſt. Such was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> appetite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. <hi>Mine heart breakes for the longing, &amp;c.</hi> and that not at ſome fits, <hi>but at all times.</hi> This good cheere never came amiſſe to him, his ſtomacke was ever good, hee could at any time <hi>eate,</hi> and fall <hi>heartily</hi> to.</p>
                  <p>And thus did they eate the Word, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.20. when they had ſuch an earneſt appetite to eate the Word that Chriſt and his Diſciples had not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>ſo much as to eate bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In a taſte and reliſhing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:150587:150"/> the Word. Men eate to be nouriſhed, now thoſe things that have no taſte in them they nouriſh not, chaffe, ſtraw, ſtickes have no taſte in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee eate them not, becauſe they will not nouriſh us. <hi>Is there any taſte in the white of an egge? Job</hi> 6.6. And therefore having no ſavour or taſte in it, of it ſelfe yeelds little nouriſhment. Yea though a man doe eate ſavoury meate, yet if his taſte were gone, would it doe him good? In Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy ſome ſenſes are of <hi>commodity,</hi> as hearing, ſeeing, ſmelling, a man may be without theſe, but not ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly, ſome are ſenſes of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> as taſting and feeling, without theſe a man cannot live at all. Indeed in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity all ſenſes are ſenſes of <hi>neceſsity.</hi> Seeing the Word a ſenſe of neceſſity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>O generation ſee the Word of the Lord.</hi> Hearing a ſenſe of neceſſity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Faith comes by hearing.</hi> And ſpecially taſting, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milke of the Word, that yee may grow thereby, if ſo be yee have taſted that the Lord is gracious.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:150587:150"/> Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>If they have taſted the good w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rd of God.</hi> And this taſting is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under eating, for then doth a man taſte his meate when hee eates it. There is a queſtion, <hi>Job</hi> 12.11. <hi>Doth not the eare try words? and the mouth taſte his meate?</hi> And an anſwer to it, <hi>Job</hi> 34.3. <hi>The eare tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meate.</hi> Looke as in eating the mouth taſteth meate, ſo in hearing the word, and in eating of it, the ſoule takes the ſweetneſſe of it. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> eates the word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taste, ſweeter then hony to my mouth. David</hi> did eate the word, and in eating taſted the ſweetneſſe of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In a delight and pleaſure in it. There is a naturall and lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure that a man takes in eating, which ariſes from the taſte of his meates. The ſweetneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of meate taſted in the eating of it, doth give a man a great deale of contentment and cheering, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.25. <hi>They did eate, and delighted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thy great goodneſſe, viz.</hi> that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:150587:151"/> goodneſſe of Gods which they taſted in the goodneſſe of the creature: That goodneſſe of the creature which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a gladneſſe in their hearts, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>He fills our hearts with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> So when wee are commanded to eate the word, it is required that wee heare, receive, and obey it with a delight and gladneſſe of heart. So did the Prophet eate it here, <hi>J did eate them, and thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoycing of mine heart.</hi> No man takes more joy and delight in eating his food, then I doe in the <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> thy Word.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in chewing the Word by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> meditation, and ſtudy upon it. A man when hee eates, hee firſt chewes his meate before hee lets it downe. If a man gulpe or ſwallow his meat downe whole, hee cannot be ſaid properly to eate. In eating, the teeth muſt doe their office in grinding, and chewing it, and ſo preparing it for the ſtomacke. So this eating implyes the duty of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtudy, and meditation upon the Word heard. <hi>The beaſts that did not
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:150587:151"/> chew the cud were not cleane.</hi> In the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Word, this chewing of it by meditation is a ſpeciall thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. There is a three-fold uſe of chewing our meate in eating of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the grinding and chewing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the meate with our teeth expreſſes and cruſhes forth the juyce and ſucculency of it, and ſo makes a man taſte and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſweetneſſe of it, and makes him take the more delight in eating his meate. A man that ſwallowes his meate whole doth not taſte that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſavourineſſe in it, becauſe the ſucculency of it is not cruſhed forth. So meditation, and chewing the word it wrings and cruſhes forth the ſavory ſucculency of the word. A man that barely heares the Word, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes down a whole Sermon at once, and never takes it in pieces, nor chewes it by meditation, feeles nor taſtes not that ſavorous delicacy and ſweetneſſe in the word that others doe that chew it by meditation: And hee is <hi>Davids</hi> bleſſed man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Whoſe delight
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:150587:152"/> is in the Law of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> grinding and chewing the meate fits it for digeſtion and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Chewing facilitates concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chewed meate is ſooner and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier digeſted then meate ſwallowed whole. Meate ſwallowed whole is unwholſome, it makes the breath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury, it makes concoction the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the ſlower. And ſo meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prepares the word for ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. The word chewed when it is eaten, is the eaſier brought into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> chewing meate prevents dangers, there may be pinnes, ſtones, yea poyſon in a mans meate, and when a man ſwallowes his meate whole, all theſe may goe downe undiſcerned, but when a man chewes his meate, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently findes ſuch offenſive things, and puts them out, and ſo ſaves the choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and poyſoning. Nay, though neither pinnes nor poyſon in a mans meat, yet the ſwallowing of his meate whole, may choake him, and make him miſcarry. When men after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:150587:152"/> doe chew the cud by meditation, they come to diſcerne, and finde out many things, which if they were let downe, might choake and poyſon the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>This then is a maine duty in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the word to chew it. The word is not rightly and kindly eaten when it is not chewed: Therefore is not the ſweetneſſe of the Word taſted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not the Word ſo kindly digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore are many choaked and poyſoned, becauſe it is ſwallowed whole without chewing. One of the Symptomes, or <hi>in commoda ſenectutis, Ecclcſ.</hi> 12.3.16. <hi>The grinders ceaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are few,</hi> was the margent rules, <hi>the grinders faile becauſe they grinde little.</hi> And ſo in this caſe, a great deale of miſcarriage is in this kinde, becauſe men altogether uſe their eares, and not their teeth, the grinders faile, and they grinde little, their is much hearing, but there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meditation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In ſwallowing and letting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5,"/> downe the Word. If a man doe take

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:150587:154"/> meat into his mouth, and chew it, yet if hee ſwallow it not downe, but put it forth againe, hee cannot be ſaid to eate. Neither chewing without ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, nor ſwallowing without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is properly eating, but in eating there muſt be both chewing and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. So in the eating of the word, it muſt not onely be heard, taſted, chewed, but it muſt be let downe and ſwallowed, <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.44. <hi>Let theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſinke downe into your eares,</hi> and ſo downe into your hearts. So muſt the Word be eaten, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to eate the roule, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Sonne of man eate that thou findeſt, eate this roule.</hi> I, but how muſt hee eate it? would it ſerve to take it into his mouth? <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>So I opened my mouth, and he cauſed me to eate the roule.</hi> Well, but would the opening of his mouth, and eating it with his mouth ſerve the turne? No, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Sonne of man cauſe thy belly to eate, fill thy bowels with this roule that I give thee.</hi> So in the eating of the Word delivered to us, it is not enough to take it into our mouths, but we muſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:150587:154"/> ſwallow it downe, cauſe our belly to eate it, and not onely fill our eares, our heads, &amp; memories, but we muſt fil our bellies, and our bowels with it. This is done when wee not onely heare and meditate upon it, but when it is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and concocted by us, that wee by obedience and conformity to it even become one vvith it; As vvhen meate is eaten and digeſted, it becomes one vvith the ſubſtance of the body. This point of eating is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Yee have obeyed from the heart that forme of doctrine whereunto ye were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> That looke as meate eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one with the body, and takes the ſame forme with it; ſo then is the Word eaten when we yeeld ſuch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, as that we are delivered into the forme of the Word. And this is indeede the maine and principall thing in this eating: And till this be done the Word is not eaten. Many have a conceit that they eate the Word, becauſe they heare, take ſome delight in it, &amp;c. but in the mean while they yeeld not obedience to it, bring
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:150587:155"/> it not into practiſe, it is in their eares, it is in their mouthes, it is in their note Bookes, but it is not in their bellies, and bowels. It is juſt with them as in that caſe with thoſe. <hi>Jſa.</hi> 29.8. <hi>As an hungry man dreames, and behold he eates</hi> as in his dreame, hee dreames he eates, <hi>but he awakes, and his ſoule is empty.</hi> And ſo many, they dreame they eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they heare, &amp;c. but yet their ſoule is empty, and their belly is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe they never cauſed their belly to eate, they never filled their bowels, the Word never yet ſanke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts to worke them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it.</p>
                  <p>And thus in theſe things ſtands this duty of eating, and this is the duty that wee are to doe. And that we may be ſtirred up to it, conſider theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> eating the Word, it is both the meanes and the ſigne of ſpiritiuall life. It is the meanes of life. Eating maintaines life, let a man give up ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hee muſt give up living; no eating, no life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.15. <hi>Give us
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:150587:155"/> bread, for why ſhould wee dye in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</hi> And if they had bread, yet if they did not eate it, if they had kept it in their cupboords, laid it by, and lookt on it, they had dyed nevertheleſſe. It is not the having but the eating of bread that makes men live, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.2. <hi>We tooke up corne, that we may eate and live.</hi> Men may have meat, and may have bread, and yet if they eate it not they may dye. And when once men leave eating, it is a ſigne they are neere dying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.18. <hi>Their ſoule abhorreth all manner of meate: and they draw neere to the gates of death.</hi> It is a ſigne men are in a dying condition when once they are paſt eating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe eating is the meanes of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of life. So it is here, eating the Word is the meanes of ſpirituall life. The Word is called <hi>the Word of life.</hi> It is called <hi>our life, Deut.</hi> 32.46, 47. and ſo eating the Word is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that which is life, and eating of life the meanes of life. There was an eating by which death entred into the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:150587:156"/> eateſt thereof ſurely ſhalt thou dye.</hi> But this eating is that by which life comes to us, and in the day that we eare the Word living wee doe live, we have hereby the life of grace, and ſhall be aſſured of the life of glory. They that eate of this bread ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll live for ever, and not dye at all: That as <hi>Joh</hi> 6.48, 49, 50. <hi>I am that bread of life. Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eate Manna in the Wilderneſſe, and are dead. This is the bread which commeth downe from heaven, that a man may eate thereof, and not dye:</hi> So in this caſe. And looke as Chriſt againe ſpeakes of eating himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 54. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verely, verely, I ſay unto you, Except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood ye have no life in you. Whoſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> So here alſo, for Chriſt is eaten by eating the Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Buy and eate, verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Heare and you ſhall live. Bleſſed are they that eate bread in the Kingdome of God.</hi> No eating bread in Gods Kingdome, unleſſe fitſt wee
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:150587:156"/> eate the Word here. And ſo bleſſed are they that eate the Word, for they ſhall eate bread in the Kingdome of God; They ſhall eate, and live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And as it is a meanes, ſo a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life. When men doe eate the Word, it is a ſigne they are alive, and and in ſpirituall health. A dead man cannot eate, onely living men eate, and when men eate and fall hard to their meate, it is a ſigne that they are alive, and their health good. When men can eate, and fall hard to the Word, it is a ſigne that they are in life and health. Therefore as yee would uſe the meanes, as have a ſigne of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, ſo eate the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which moved <hi>Eve</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> eate the forbidden fruit, ſhould move us to eate the commanded fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>And when the Woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired, to make one wiſe, ſhe tooke of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and did eate, and gave alſo unto her husband with her, and he did eate.</hi> So here, the word is good, good for food,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:150587:157"/> it is that which is to be deſired to make one wiſe, therefore let us take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and eate heartily of it. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Word is that which ſhould move to eate. Good meate tempts men to eate, and though men have no great ſtomacke, yet if they heare meat commended for good meate, they will eate of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Hearken, and eate that which is good.</hi> And it is <hi>Salomons</hi> argument, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Heare yee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the inſtruction of a father: and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know underſtanding. For I give good doctrine.</hi> Yea and hee preſſes this duty of eating upon this ground, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.13, 14. <hi>My ſonne, eate thou hony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good, and the hony combe, which is ſweet to thy taſte. So ſhall the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of wiſdome be unto thy ſoule: when thou haſt found it, then there ſhall be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and thy expectation ſhall not be cut off.</hi> The ſumme is, As when men finde honey, they doe not forbeare, but will fall to and eate, becauſe they know it is ſo ſweet and good: So when thou findeſt the Word, fall to and eate that alſo, for that is good, and that will be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:150587:157"/> as good and ſweet to thy ſoule when thou ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Men ſtand much upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> taking and eating the Sacramentall bread, and put not a little in the eating of it, but in the meane time make little regard of eating the Word. They would take it very ill if they ſhould be kept from eating Sacramentall bread, and yet in the meane time willingly and voluntarily abſtaine from eating the bread of the Word: Therefore let men know that there is a greater neceſſity of eating the Word then is of eating the Sacrament. A man may be ſaved if hee eate not the Sacramen, but a man cannot be ſaved if hee eate not the Word. It may fall out that a man cannot have the Sacrament, but yet if a man doe eate the Word, in ſuch a caſe the not eating of the Sacrament ſhall be no prejudice to him. And beſides how ever men conceive of their eating bread in the Sacrament, yet the truth is, that a man is never fit, nor prepared to eate the Sacrament, till hee doe firſt eate the Word. The
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:150587:158"/> Word not firſt received, beleeved, and obeyed, a man hath no right to, and ſhall have no benefit by eating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for he that eates not the word cannot eate Chriſt in the Sacrament; and what is a man the better for <hi>eating</hi> the Sacrament, if hee <hi>eate</hi> not Chriſt? <hi>They did all eate of the ſame ſpirituall meat, and yet with many of them God was not well pleaſed.</hi> And why ſo? becauſe though they did eate Manna a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, yet they did not eate the Word, and yeeld obedience from the heart to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 5.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that which <hi>David</hi> did, wee ought all to doe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>I have hid thy Word in mine heart.</hi> It is to be hid and kept ſafe. There is no ſuch way to hide it, and lay it up ſafe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as to eate it. Bodily bread, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes, when it is in the cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, it may bee taken away by theeves, eaten of mice, may mould, and be waſted, but when it is eaten it is ſafe from all ſuch danger: So the Word is never ſo ſafely hid as when once it is eaten. After the miracles of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:150587:158"/> the loaves, our Saviour bids <hi>gather up the fragments, and ſee,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that nothing be loſt.</hi> The onely way to ſee that nothing of this bread be loſt, is to eate it. It is never loſt that is eaten.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> if people muſt eate the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Word, then they muſt give them to eate. How can they eate, that have nothing to eate? <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The young children aske bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</hi> In ſuch a caſe they might aske bread, but they could not eate bread; where bread was not given, bread could not be eaten. Many would eate bread if they had it. And that people have it not, and eate it not, it is the fault of ſuch Miniſters as give it not, and breake it not. Many keepe their people at ſuch ſhort commons, that they have not to eate, ſo farre from having their bellies full, that they get not ſo much as a <hi>mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if people muſt eate, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as Miniſters muſt give them to eate, ſo
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:150587:159"/> ſo they muſt give them ſuch as they may eate. A man may give bread and meate to be eaten, and yet it may be ſuch ſtuffe as cannot be eaten, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>If a ſon ſhall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a ſtone?</hi> That were the way to choake him, and not to feed him: <hi>Or if he aske a fiſh, will he for a fiſh give him a Serpent?</hi> That were the way to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon him, and not to cheriſh him. Men cannot eate ſtones, mens teeth are not able to chew and grinde them, nor their ſtomackes able to digeſt them. A man may preach, and yet preach ſo as people can finde nothing in it that they may eate. Schoole points, and quiddities that tranſcends vulgar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities are ſtony food, not ſtones turned into bread, as Satan would have Chriſt have done, but rather bread turned into ſtones. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That ſhall feed you with underſtanding.</hi> Therefort that which muſt be eaten muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Men dare not eate Serpents and Scorpions, who can blame them if they feare to be poyſoned. See how
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:150587:159"/> Chriſt was uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.21. <hi>They gave me alſo gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me vineger to drinke.</hi> And therefore when it was tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.23. <hi>They gave it him, but he received it not.</hi> And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if people receive not, and eate not meate mingled with gall, when they are fed with bitter invectives. <hi>Hold faſt the forme of ſound, or wholſome words.</hi> Now many doe ſet before people ſuch rotten and unwholſome food, ſuch traſh and unſavoury food, and ſuch poyſonous ſtuffe, that it is with people as it was with them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.40. <hi>As they were eating of the pottage, they cryed out, O man of God, Death is in the pot. And they could not eate thereof.</hi> So it is here, there is coloquintida and wilde goards in the pot, many times a whole lap full, and when there is death in the pot, what wonder that people cannot eate thereof.</p>
                  <p>Or if men preach truth, yet it is done with ſuch unbeſeeming levity and vanity, after ſuch a ſtage faſhion, that there is no nouriſhing ſubſtance in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:150587:160"/> it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>ſhall feed you with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> with that which ſhall edifie and build you up in knowledge, not with huskes as the prodigall was fed.</p>
                  <p>Or if truth propounded, yet it is meate ſo negligently dreſt, ſo ſluttiſhly cooked, that the very ſight of it takes away mens ſtomackes, that as <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> in another caſe <hi>made the people abhoorre and loath the Lords offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;</hi> ſo many ſo marre the meate in the dreſſing, that men can have no ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke to eate it. So that it may bee ſaid of many Sermons, as the Prophet ſpeakes of thoſe Figges, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.2. <hi>And the other basket had very naughty Figges which could not be eaten they were ſo bad.</hi> And as your proverbe is, <hi>God ſends meat, and the Divell ſends Cookes.</hi> So it may be more truely ſaid in this caſe, God ſends meate and gives his Word, but there be many Cookes not of his ſending, that make ſuch rotten meate, ſuch ſlovenly meate, ſuch traſhy meat, ſuch bitter meat, ſuch unſavoury loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat, that it cannot be eaten for badneſſe. Therefore ſince people muſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:150587:160"/> eate, let us be carefull to give them to eate, and to give them that they may eate, ſound and ſavoury food, and well and handſomely dreſt.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> neglect of this duty, that they doe not fall to and eate when it is ſet before them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Yee ſay,</hi> as you, <hi>the Table of the Lord is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even his meat is contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> God hee deales bountifully with men; it may be ſaid here, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.11. <hi>The Lord gave the Word, great was the company of them that publiſhed it.</hi> Wee have had preaching, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and this ſpirituall food, Gods plenty, wiſdome cryes out to men, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Come eate of my bread.</hi> And Chriſt calls upon men, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Eate O friends, and fall to, and take your filles.</hi> And yet men ſit and looke on, and regard neither this food, nor theſe invitations, but deale with the Lord as <hi>Salomon</hi> wiſhes men to deale with a churle, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.6, 7. <hi>Eate not the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:150587:161"/> bread of him that hath an evill eye, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire his dainty meates, eate and drinke ſaith he, but his heart is not with thee.</hi> Juſt ſo deale men with the Lord, when he calls upon them to eate the Word, as if God had an evill eye, as if his heart were not with them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, as the Word and food is good, ſo alſo is his eye good, and his heart is with us, and it would be meate and drinke to him to ſee us fall to, and eate heartily. Such carriage at our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Tables would be conſtrued a diſcurteſie, and men would force themſelves to eate againſt their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, rather then to give their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at his Table. And yet wee ſtand not upon giving the Lord ſuch groſſe diſguſts, as not to eate when he layes and ſets meate before us. There is much preaching, and yet but little eating. Many inſtead of eating the <hi>Word,</hi> could finde in their hearts to eat the <hi>Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what thinke we is the reaſon that men eate the word no more then they doe?</p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:150587:161"/>
                  <p>It is from theſe three cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> from fulneſſe. <hi>The full ſoule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> loathes the honey combe, Prov.</hi> 27.7. When a mans belly is full, hee hath not onely no minde to eate, but hee loathes to eate, and that not onely courſe and common foode, but the daintieſt and ſweeteſt food, hee trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth under foot the honey combe. <hi>The Word is honey, and this honey is to be eaten when it is found, Prov.</hi> 24.13. And yet when men finde it, they eate it not, but loath it, and tread upon it. And the reaſon is becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready full. Such a fulneſſe as that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Being filled with all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, fornication, wickedneſſe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, maliciouſneſſe, full of envy, murther, debate, deceit, malignity, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some feed ſo full upon that hony, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.3. <hi>The honey which drops from the lips of a ſtrange woman,</hi> that they tread this honey combe under foot. There be a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:150587:162"/> great many that eate as the Serpent doth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Duſt ſhalt thou eate all the dayes of thy life.</hi> All worldly hearts are of the Serpents dyet, they eate duſt, and ſo fill themſelves with the duſt of the earth, that they loath to eate the Word. Becauſe mens hearts are ſtuft with this <hi>baggage</hi> and <hi>baſe</hi> food, therefore will not men eate this <hi>Angels</hi> food, this bread of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> from lingring and hankring after ſome other food. Such a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition takes off the ſtomack from whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food. <hi>The Iſraelites had Angels food, the bread of Heaven,</hi> and yet at laſt this food would not down with them, nay <hi>they loathed their Manna:</hi> And a man will not eate what hee loathes. But what was the cauſe that they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to eate manna? See <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>They fell a luſting (or they luſted a luſt) and ſaid, who ſhall give us fleſh to eate?</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>fiſh to eate, and they long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the garlicke and onyons of Egypt;</hi> and therefore now this Manna will not downe with them. So men, when
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:150587:162"/> once they begin to luſt a luſt after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in doctrine, the wholſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury truth of God they begin to loath, they are weary of it, quite cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, then no wonder it is not eaten. When once mens lippes hang after Egyptian food, popiſh and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine, then truth will not downe by any meanes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>He feedeth on aſhes.</hi> That is but ſtrange food, a mad dyet for a man to live and feed on aſhes. But what makes him feed ſo fondly? <hi>A deceived heart hath turned him aſide.</hi> So with many. deceived heart hath turned them aſide, and then they fall to eating of aſhes, and therefore, like thoſe that have the greene ſickneſſe, their mindes hang af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſhes, and ſuch traſh, and ſo no mind to the wholſome food of ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. See the caſe cleare, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>They will not endure it,</hi> therefore not eate it, not indure it, as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the meate he loathes. But why not indure it? <hi>They have itching eares,</hi> that itch after novelties, and therefore <hi>ſhall turn away their eares, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:150587:163"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from ſickneſſe, or if yee will from deadneſſe. Sicke men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their meate, and refuſe their meat. Men are ſpiritually ſicke, and have ſome diſeaſes upon them that make them eate nothing at all, or elſe they doe but piddle, and trifle, as good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit, as never the better. Nay, men are dead, void of the life of God, and that's a maine reaſon that they eat not. Dead men cannot eate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſince it is a duty that muſt be done, therefore let people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves whether they doe it or not, whether the Word be eaten by them or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may one know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he eates the Word or not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſpirituall cheerefulneſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> livelineſſe and quickning. When a man hath eaten, it makes him cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and lively, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. <hi>He fills our heart with food and gladneſſe.</hi> A man when hee hath faſted, and long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne his meate, his ſpirits waſte and decay; but when hee eates, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:150587:163"/> his ſpirits, and renewes them, and ſo makes a man come to himſelfe, and makes him freſh and lively. See <hi>Jonathans</hi> caſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.27, 29, 30. Hee was faint and his ſpirits ſpent ſo, that his eyes began to grow dimme through faintneſſe and want of ſpirit, <hi>and he doth but eate a little honey,</hi> and his ſpirits are refreſht, and repaired, that <hi>his eyes were enlightned.</hi> And if but a <hi>taſte</hi> of the honey did ſo much, <hi>How much more ſayes Jonathan, if the people had eaten freely,</hi> had they beene chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and repaired. Wee finde a man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.12. <hi>that had eaten nothing in three dayes and three nights,</hi> by reaſon of which his ſpirits were quite gone, and hee was even a dead man: But ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>And when he had eaten, his ſpirit came againe unto him.</hi> It was in a manner gone from him before, but now hee had eaten hee was ſo refreſht and cheered, that hee was alive againe, his ſpirit came againe.</p>
                  <p>So it is in this eating, it fills the ſoule with cheerefulneſſe and livelineſſe. A man that eates the Word indeed findes
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:150587:164"/> his heart finely cheered, filled with ſpirits, <hi>Thy words were found by me, and I did eate them.</hi> How did that appeare? <hi>And it was unto me the joy and rejoycing of mine heart:</hi> Oh how mine heart was cheered within mee, oh how my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was refreſht! <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. <hi>My ſonne, if thou finde honey,</hi> as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did, <hi>eate it for it is good.</hi> So eate this honey for it is good. Why what good will follow upon it? If thou be faint, lumpiſh, ſpirits downe, dim ſighted, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten thine eyes, it will ſo cheere thy ſpirits, that it will recover thy deadneſſe, and dimneſſe, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and enliven thee. When that man had eaten, his ſpirit came againe: If before thou wert dead, and heavy, and lumpiſh unto good duties, yet if thou doe eate the Word, one good meale of it will recover thee out of that deadneſſe, and make thee lively and cheerefull in duties of worſhip and obedience. By this try thy ſelfe. If thus it be with thee, thou haſt eaten the Word, but the <hi>little</hi> quickning, refreſhing, the little enſpiriting of men
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:150587:164"/> after the Word heard, argues how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle men doe eate it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> by ſpirituall ſatisfaction. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2,"/> A man that is hungry his ſtomack is ſtil craving, and he deſiring ſomething that he wants, and let him have this, or that, yet hee is not ſatisfied, unleſſe he may eate. Mirth, muſick, company, pleaſure, let an hungry man have, yet there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes no ſatisfaction, ſtill his ſtomacke craves. But let a man but eate, then there is a ſatisfaction, and that craving is over. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.25. <hi>They did eate and they were filled.</hi> And ſo in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the loaves, it is ſaid, <hi>they did all eate and were filled,</hi> their hunger was allayed and ſatisfied. So it is here: The heart of man is full of cravings, and hungrings after profits, pleaſures, vanities, luſts, and though a man eate of theſe never ſo much, theſe ſatisfie not the hungry cravings of the heart, nay the more they are fed upon, ſtill the heart craves them more: But now when a man eates the Word, all theſe cravings of the heart ceaſe, and are ſatisfied. A man upon eating the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:150587:165"/> Word findes ſuch ſatisfaction in it, and his heart ſo fitted, that it is at reſt from thoſe troubleſome and inordinate cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, theſe unnaturall dogged appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are quenched. The ſoule that eates the Word findes it ſelfe ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied, that it lingers not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the profits and pleaſures of the world. Hee that eates this Manna lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not after the fleſh-pots, the ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and garlicke of Egypt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Wherefore doe yee ſpend mony for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto me, and eate yee that which is good, and let your ſoule delight it ſelfe in fatneſſe:</hi> though theſe things then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie not, yet the Word it ſatisfies, and fills, and feeds, and fattens.</p>
                  <p>By this may men try themſelves, if they have ſo received the Word, as that their hearts are weaned from their carnall and worldly luſts, thoſe inſatiable cravings are at an end, ſuch ſatisfaction is a ſigne that a man hath eaten: But the contrary ſhewes how few have eaten. Many would ſeeme
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:150587:165"/> to eate, and profeſſe they have eaten, but yet their hunger after the world, their profits and pleaſures, are as keene and as eager as ever. Their hearts doe reſtleſly crave theſe things. Thine heart is not <hi>filled,</hi> therefore thou haſt not <hi>eaten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by ſpirituall ſtrength, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fatneſſe, good liking, good complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo it is in bodily eating, keep men from eating and their ſtrength decayes, they grow feeble, their complexion decayes, and they looke with an ill complexion, pale, wan, and ill colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As wee ſee in a ſiege, when men have beene coopt up, and have not had meate to eate, they have come out like ſo many dead carkaiſes out of their graves, ſo weake, ſo poore, ſuch ghoſtly lookes, as it is enough to ſcare a man with the ſight of them. But now eating mends all this, that breeds good blood, health, ſtrength, fatneſſe, and a good habitude of body. Upon eating followes ſtrength, ſtrength to walke, and to worke, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. <hi>And he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and did eate and drinke, and went in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:150587:166"/> the ſtrength of that meate forty dayes and forty nights, unto Horeb the mount of God.</hi> Upon eating followes fatneſſe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.25. <hi>They did eate, and they were fat.</hi> Upon eating followes goodneſſe of complexion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.13. upon the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this pulſe, <hi>their countenances were faire and fat.</hi> And thus is it upon eating the Word, men have ſtrength in their ſoules to walke in the wayes of God, men grow fat, grow up as calves of the ſtall, <hi>full of good, Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>they are fat, and flouriſhing, Pſal.</hi> 92.14. They have faire and good complexi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, their wiſdome and other graces cauſe their faces to ſhine, their lives and carriages are faire and lovely. And by this may men know whether they have eaten the Word or not. If it be thus with them, that they have ſtrength againſt their luſts, if they have ſtrength to walke in obedience, &amp;c. a ſigne they have eaten the Word. But this ſhewes that few have eaten and doe eate the Word.</p>
                  <p>Many ſay they doe, but how is it they be ſo weake and ſo feeble, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:150587:166"/> they cannot walke and worke? How is it that they be ſo leane, that there is ſuch an emptineſſe of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Why art thou, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings ſonne leane, or thin from day to day?</hi> ſo how is it that thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kings dyet, the bread of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, art thus thin and leane? How is it that thy life, thy complexion mends not, but thy complexion and converſation is ſo ill? It fares with many as in that caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.18.21. When the ſeven leane kine and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured had eaten up the fat, <hi>It could not be knowne that they had eaten them, they were ſtill as hadgeld hildings and carrion-like ſcroyles as before.</hi> So here, men ſay they have eaten, but looke on their lives, and it cannot be knowne, as arrant ſcroyles as ever, as very ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, drunkards, as ever, as proud, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, looſe as ever. A cleare ſigne that ſuch doe not eate the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they that eate the word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will ever doe as <hi>Eve</hi> did when ſhee did eate the forbidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who gave alſo to her husband, and hee
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:150587:167"/> did eate;</hi> ſo ever here. There is no ſuch good fellowſhip as in this eating, where there is no man that would eate alone, As <hi>Job</hi> 31.17. where that holy man profeſſeth, <hi>That hee had not eaten his morſell himſelfe alone, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe had not eaten thereof:</hi> ſo here, none that eateth the Word of God eateth his morſell himſelfe alone, and giveth not the fatherleſſe and needy ſoule to eate thereof: But as in <hi>Samſons</hi> Riddle <hi>Out of the eater came meate:</hi> ſo here out of the eater of the Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth meate to feed others, judge by this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the Word muſt be eaten, then it teacheth us to be frequent in hearing, and diligent in taking all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. Some men can content themſelves, if need be, with one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in a yeere, and it is enough a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience if well followed: One meale in a yeere were ſhort commons. A man deſires to eate every day twice, ſome thrice a day. There is a neceſſity of eating frequently: ſo here, take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of hearing and reading the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:150587:167"/> Word, ſome morſell every day, and miſſe not publike meales. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.5. &amp; 7. where <hi>the Prophet Eliah was by the Angel bidden to eate,</hi> and hee did ſo; yea though hee had eaten but juſt before, yet hee goes to it againe the ſecond time, <hi>being bidden a ſecond time.</hi> If thou have eaten in the morning, yet, if God call to it a ſecond time, eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the afternoone. If thou have eaten on the Sabboth, yet if God give opportunity and liberty, eate alſo on the weeke day. The Word is to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and eating muſt bee frequent and often.</p>

Dehorting from drunkenneſſe he prefaces thereto onely in one verſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. but dehorting from whoredome hee prefaces to that counſell in five verſes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. to 26. <hi>It is the more hainous evill of the time, and of more miſchievous conſequence.</hi> It is a ſinne to which our nature is more prone and inclinable; and therefore to keepe men off from it, he makes the hedge the ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>In this Preface hee gives ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, as being liſtned to, may prove ſtrong preſervatives againſt the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that peſtilence. One is that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. Reſpect and obedience to parents holy counſels. Thoſe heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to would be ſpeciall meanes to ſave men out of thoſe ſnares. Another in this verſe, which is an exhortation to the ſtudy and acquiſition of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, grace, and Religion, with which the heart being effectually ſeaſoned, it would in ſpeciall manner ſave a man
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:150587:170"/> from that ſinne. And ſo it ſuites with that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 16, 17. <hi>When wiſedome entreth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleaſant unto thy ſoule; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſhall preſerve thee, underſtanding ſhall keepe thee: To deliver thee from the way of the evill man, from the man that ſpeaketh froward things. To deliver thee from the ſtrange woman, even from the ſtranger which flattereth with her words: Which forſaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</hi> Wiſdome and truth, godlineſſe and grace will preſerve both from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill man, and the evill woman. Thus this verſe ſtands in coherence with the others.</p>
                  <p>Take the words now in themſelves conſidered, and they are an exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſtirre up men to beſtirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all paines and diligence, to get knowledge, godlineſſe, grace, &amp;c. for that is comprehended under <hi>truth, wiſdome, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Let it be your maine care and labour, to get the knowledge of the truth, to get grace and Religion into your hearts.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:150587:171"/> And this counſell is laid downe under a metaphor, <hi>Buy the truth,</hi> by which he implyes with what deſire and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and coſt, it ſhould be ſought, that men ſhould ſo looke after it, and ſeeke to compaſſe it, as men uſe to doe after commodities of uſe and worth. Thoſe men will buy, for thoſe men will trade, and lay out their mony that they may get the poſſeſſion of them. So here hee would have them ſo affected to the truth, that they ſhould trade for it, be at paines and coſt for the compaſſing and getting of it. And when they have once gotten and purchaſed this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, they ſhould by no meanes part with it againe, but hold and keepe it faſt, <hi>ſell it not.</hi> When once men have made the bargaine, and gotten this good penny-worth, by no meanes part with it againe, part with it upon no termes what price ſoever is offered for it.</p>
                  <p>So then here be two things in theſe words:
<list>
                        <item>1. A precept, <hi>Buy the truth.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. A prohibition, <hi>Sell it not.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:150587:171"/>
                  <p>Firſt to to begin with the precept, <hi>Buy the truth, alſo wiſdome, inſtruction, and underſtanding,</hi> or as ſome tranſlate, <hi>Buy the truth, of wiſdome, &amp;c.</hi> Buy the truth. I, but what truth, or what doe you meane by truth? That truth which is of wiſdome, of inſtruction, of underſtanding, the truth that is in piety, godlineſſe, religion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godlineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That truth, wiſdome, underſtanding,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> 
                     <hi>godlineſſe, grace and religion are not to be had for nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the duty of every one to uſe all meanes and diligence to get the truth, to be willing to be at the coſt of all paines and diligence for the buying and compaſſing the truth, wiſdome, godlineſſe, &amp;c. Theſe are commodities which will not be had without coſt. They are commodities that will not fall into mens mouthes, but they muſt be bought. Hee ſayes not, <hi>Take</hi> the truth, as if it might be had for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up, but <hi>buy</hi> the truth; there muſt be a price given for it, and men
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:150587:172"/> muſt be at coſt before they can have it.</p>
                  <p>See how <hi>Araunah</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.22. <hi>Let my Lord the King take, and offer up what ſcemes good unto him, &amp;c.</hi> and ſee <hi>Davids</hi> anſwer, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Nay but I will ſurely buy it of thee at a price, neither will I offer of that which doth coſt me nothing:</hi> So here, many it may be would be content to have theſe things, if they might have them for ſtooping and taking up. Nay, but they muſt buy it at a price, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we ſhould think to have truth for <hi>that which doth coſt us nothing.</hi> It muſt coſt men a price, and a good round price too, <hi>Buy the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that we have elſewhere, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Get wiſdome, get understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>With all thy gettings get underſtanding.</hi> It is the ſelfe-ſame word that is uſed here, and may be, as it is by ſome tranſlated, <hi>Buy wiſdome, buy underſtanding,</hi> and with all thy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>buy underſtanding. Get it,</hi> ſay ſome; <hi>Buy it,</hi> ſay others, it all comes to one, for it is to be gotten with buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:150587:172"/> The way to <hi>get</hi> it, is to <hi>buy</hi> it. It is not a commodity that goes a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; it muſt be bought before it can be got. It is the counſell that Chriſt gives, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counſell thee to buy of me Gold tryed in the fire.</hi> Could not Chriſt give it as a matter of Almes? No, hee will have it bought, or they ſhall goe without it. He doth not ſay, I counſell thee to <hi>take</hi> gold of mee, but to <hi>buy</hi> gold of mee, hee will have men draw, and draw deep too before they have it.</p>
                  <p>It is that is called for, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come ye, buy and eate, buy Wine and milk.</hi> It is not enough to come and looke and gaze upon this commodity, to praiſe and commend it, no not enough to bid for it, and offer for it, but wee muſt ſtrike through the bargaine, and buy it. A man may bid and not buy, but wee muſt bid and buy both. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. <hi>The man that findes the treaſure in the field, goes and buyes the field.</hi> Hee doth not wiſh hee had the field, he doth not bid money for the field, and then leave it, but hee goes
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:150587:173"/> thorow with the bargaine, hee buyes, and purchaſes the field. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 45, 46. <hi>The Merchant when bee finds a pearle of great price, hee buyes it.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould be Merchants, men that drive a trade. When commodities are ſet forth in Marts and Fayres, yee have many country people will come and gaze upon them, and will cheapen, and be asking the prices, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meane to buy them: They will cheapen pearles and jewels, &amp;c. onely to know their worth and prices; but now when a Merchant comes, he chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and buyes: So Chriſtians driving a trade for Heaven, and being Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they muſt buy thoſe pearles, buy thoſe commodities that are ſet to ſale.</p>
                  <p>There be foure things that may make a man willing to buy the truth. The ſame things that make men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay out their money for other commodities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1,"/> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is a neceſſary and uſefull commodity. Indeed things that a man hath no need of, no uſe of, hee hath
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:150587:173"/> no minde to buy, or to lay out his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for them. It is no providence nor good husbandry, to buy ſuch things as hee hath no need or uſe of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.29. <hi>Buy thoſe things that we have need of.</hi> If a man want bread, want clothing for him and his, hee is willing to lay out his money, and to buy them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things hee hath need of. Neceſſity forces him to buy theſe: So here, the truth is a neceſſary commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, an uſefull commodity. It was when Chriſt was diſperſing, and many hearing the Word of truth, that Chriſt ſpake that ſpeech, <hi>One thing is needfull:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Thou thinkeſt much at <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhee is at this market, that ſhe is buying this commodity, but blame her not, it is a needfull commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and therefore ſhee doth well to buy it. It is as neceſſary as Heaven and ſalvation it ſelfe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved.</hi> I, that men like well, but marke what followes, <hi>and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Marke then, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> till men come to the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:150587:174"/> 
                     <hi>knowledge of the truth.</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> muſt be had before <hi>Heaven</hi> can bee had. Truth therefore being ſo needfull a commodity, and ſo uſefull, there is great reaſon we ſhould be forward to buy it, and to be at coſt for it. There is a neceſſity of buying it, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at coſt for it, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counſell thee to buy of me white rayment that thou mayſt be cloathed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſſe doe not appeare.</hi> There is a neceſſity of clothing, a neceſſity of covering ones nakedneſſe, therefore a neceſſity of buying knowledge, grace, religion, godlineſſe, being things of ſuch neceſſary uſe, men muſt be at coſt and charges for them, men ought to buy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a profitable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a gainefull commodity, there is much to be gotten, and gained by the buying of it. Hee that trades in this commodity ſhall never be a loſer by it, nay hee ſhall be a great ſaver and gainer by it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Godlineſſe is great gaine.</hi> If it were but gaine it were ſomewhat, and it were enough to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:150587:174"/> croſſe the conceit of the world, that counts godlineſſe loſſe and hindrance, but that is not all, it is <hi>great gaine,</hi> it brings in great returnes, rich returnes, it brings in ſuch advantage as makes a man.</p>
                  <p>Thirty and forty in the hundred are counted great gaines in trading, but this buying and trading brings in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by farre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.27, 29. <hi>Then anſwered Peter and ſaid to him, Behold, we have forſaken all, and followed thee: what ſhall wee have? And whoſoever ſhall forſake houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my Names ſake, hee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred fold more, and ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite everlaſting life.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Lord we have beene at great coſt, and great charges to buy the truth, what ſhall wee have? what gaine will our adventure bring us in? what ſhall wee get by the buying of this commodity? Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Every one that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, &amp;c. ſhall receive an hundred fold.</hi> Where marke, that the gaine is not one for an hundred, but an hundred for
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:150587:175"/> one, as if a man ſhould lay out a pound, and gaine an hundred pound by laying out one. The gaine of buying this commodity, is like the gaine that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had by ſowing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.12. Who <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſame yeere an hundred fold.</hi> And marke againe, that it is not in this trading and buying, as it is in buying and trading in other commodities. We ſee in other trading in the World and buying, that ſome men grow very rich, gaine great eſtates, but yet many get little, many loſe and are undone by trading. But now it is not ſo here: And <hi>every one,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>that hath forſaken, &amp;c. ſhall receive an hundred fold.</hi> This commodity bought makes all gainers, gainers an hundred fold in in this life. Every Merchant of this Company is a gaining Merchant.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold profit or gaine to be had by buying the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> a mans ſpirituall freedome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from the captivity and bondage of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and luſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Yee ſhall know the truth.</hi> Know the truth? And what ſhall we get by that truth? <hi>And the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:150587:175"/> truth ſhall make you free.</hi> Wee ſee that many will give good ſummes to buy the freedome of the City. As <hi>Act.</hi> 22.28. <hi>With a great ſumme bought I this freedome, viz.</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that hee that buyes the truth, buyes his freedome, hee gaines his freedome by the bargaine, his freedome from the thraldome of his luſt, his freedome from the ſlavery of Satan: See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. <hi>If God at any time will give them repentance, that they may know the truth, And that they may come to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the ſnare of the devill, which are taken of him at his will.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Riches.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:150587:176"/> to come.</hi> But that matters not. To be ſure, it makes ſpiritually rich, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. <hi>The Church of Laodicea thought ſhee was rich, but ſhe was poore.</hi> Well, Chriſt will teach her a courſe to become rich. But what courſe is that? Shee muſt fall to trading, and to buying, to the buying of truth, of grace, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>I counſell thee to buy of me gold.</hi> But what ſhall wee be the better for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? It is a commodity, if yee buy it, will enrich you, will make you; to buy of mee gold, <hi>that thou mayst bee rich:</hi> So that the way to fetch in the gaine of ſpirituall riches, is to be buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this gold. It is a trading then wee ſee that is gainefull, it will gaine ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall riches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Life and happineſſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3.18. <hi>Shee is a Tree of life to them that lay hold upon her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that here is that ſhould make us willing to buy the truth, and be at coſt for it, and to come off roundly for it too, in that it is ſo profitable and gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a commodity. If a man ſees a commodity in the Market that will
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:150587:176"/> yeeld profit, that will bring him in gaine, hee need not be intreated to buy it, hee will be ſure to lay hold on it, to faſten upon it, hee will have it though hee borrow the money to buy it. Gainefull commodities uſe not to hang in hand, but they are preſently ſnatcht up, there is catching at ſuch commodities to buy them. The truth therefore being a commodity in which there is gaine and advantage to be had, what ever it coſt, what ever be the price, buy it, loſe not the buying of a gainefull commodity. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gaine the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule?</hi> Hee that makes ſuch a bargaine, makes but a loſing bargaine: And ſo, what ſhall it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage a man to loſe, to give the whole world, and to gaine his owne ſoule? He that makes ſuch a bargaine, makes a ſaving, a gaining bargaine. Hee that buyes the truth, though hee give the whole world for it, makes a gaining bargaine, becauſe he gaines his ſoule, and Heaven by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is a pretious commodity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:150587:177"/> of great worth and excellency, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wiſdome, and the man that getteth underſtanding. For the merchandiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is better then the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gaine thereof is better then gold. It is more precious then pearles: and all things that thou canſt deſire, are not to be compared unto her.</hi> See <hi>Job.</hi> 28.12. 16, 19. <hi>But where is wiſdome found? and where is the place of underſtanding? It ſhall not be valued with the wedge of gold of Ophir, nor with the pretious Onix, nor the Saphir. The Topaz of Ethiopia ſhall not be equall unto it, neither ſhall it be valued with the wedge of pure gold. Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>The Merchant ſeekes pearles, and he findes one pearle of great price,</hi> of great value and worth. It is no vile and paltry commodity, but a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity very pretious: And therefore worth the buying. Things that bee vile, who will buy them? refuſe ſtuffe none will lay out money about them. But when things are pretious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, their excellency tempts men to buy. What made the Merchant in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:150587:177"/> the Parable to ſell all that he had, and to buy the pearle? It was a great price to give all that hee had, it ſeemes to coſt exceeding deere. To have given halfe that he had one would thinke had been enough, but he gives all that he hath to buy it. And what was the reaſon? It was a pearle, and it was a pearle of great price: ſo Truth being a pearle, and a pearle of great price, loſe not the buying of ſo pretious a commodity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is a commodity we can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> never be over-reacht in, we cannot be cheated and coſend in. A man is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht, and coſend in buying when hee gives more for a commodity than it is worth, when the commodity bought, and the price given have no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are not of equall value, the buyer hath not a pennyworth for his penny. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.15. <hi>The land is worth foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhekels of ſilver.</hi> So long as the land was <hi>worth</hi> it, <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have an hard bargaine, could not bee over-reacht in it, could have no cauſe to repent him, though hee gave foure
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:150587:178"/> hundred ſhekels of ſilver. <hi>The land was worth it:</hi> ſo here, in buying the Truth a man ſhall bee ſure not to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht, he ſhal be ſure not to be pincht with an hard bargaine, becauſe let it coſt what it will, let the price be never ſo high, let a man give what he will, yet the truth is <hi>worth</hi> it, and a man ſhall be ſure to have a pennyworth for his penny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.15. <hi>All the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her. Prov.</hi> 8.11. <hi>For Wiſedome is better than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, and all pleaſures are not to be compared unto her.</hi> The higheſt price that can be ſet is diſproportionable to the worth of it, is beneath the value of the commodity. <hi>Iob</hi> 28.17. Though it be a neceſſary commodity, a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, gainefull commodity, a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commodity, yet at any price it is ſet at, it is a cheape commodity, and the price is low. A man cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reacht when the commodity is neceſſary, profitable, precious, and yet the price low. How can a man be over-reacht where the commodity is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:150587:178"/> profitable, and cheape both? Now this commodity as it is well worth all our paines, endevours, coſts; ſo all we can doe and give, it is but cheape, it is but an eaſie low price. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come buy wine and milke without money, and without price,</hi> that is, without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious price, as he that gives the money, and the price that a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is worth in point of commutative Juſtice deſerves to have the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and it is Injuſtice to hold it from him. Thus wee muſt buy without price, becauſe no man can give a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious price to God for Grace and Heaven. Buy without price, that is, without meritorious price; or elſe thus to our preſent purpoſe. It is true that Truth muſt bee bought with a price, and with a great price, but yet the greateſt price that is, is ſo beneath the commodity, that it is no price. As we ſay of a cheape commodity that is bought for little, that it is no price. Ten thouſand pound is a great ſumme of money, an huge ſumme, but for a man to buy ten thouſand pound a yeer
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:150587:179"/> for the price of ten thouſand pound, it is but one yeares purchaſe, it is no price, ten thouſand pound is no mony, no price to ten thouſand pound a yeere. It is a great deale of paines, and coſt that a man muſt bee at to get the Truth, to get Chriſt, and Grace, but the worth of the commodity conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and the tranſcendency of the value of it above coſt and paines, all our coſt and paines is no money, is no price. And how can a man bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht, or have an hard bargaine, when he hath a good bargaine for no price. Here is that then which may draw us on to ſtrike thorow this bargaine, and may encourage us to trade, and buy, we ſhall be ſure to have a pennyworth for our penny, we ſhall not bee pincht with a deere penny-worth. Many a man hath a great minde to ſuch an houſe, and land, he would faine buy it, he beates the price, and bids faire for it, but yet as good a minde as hee hath to it, he buyes it not, he feares it is to deere, he feares he ſhall repent him of his bargaine, and wiſh his money in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:150587:179"/> his purſe againe, and therefore falls off. But now here is no ſuch feare, what ever the Truth coſt thee, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it coſt thee much paines, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſuppoſe it proves matter of great charge to thee, ſuppoſe it coſt thee thy credit and reſpect in the world, thy liberty, thine eſtate, thy bloud, thy life, yet thou buyeſt it not too deere; it is well worth all thou canſt give for it. A man may buy houſe and lands, good houſe and lands too deere, a man may buy Gold too deere, as the Proverb is, but yet hee cannot buy Truth, nor Grace, nor Chriſt, nor Heaven too deare. <hi>The Land is worth foure hundred ſhekles,</hi> and Heaven, and Chriſt, Truth, and Grace is worth all that ever. God ſhall aske for it.</p>
                  <p>A man may buy a good purchaſe of land, and yet have no cauſe to rejoyce in it, may wiſh hee had never medled with it, but had kept his money in his purſe. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.12. <hi>The time is come, the day draweth neere, let not the buyer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> Such times may come, as a man
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:150587:180"/> may have but little joy in buying a a purchaſe. But a man that buyes the Truth ſhall never repent him of his purchaſe, but let ſuch a buyer rejoyce. Come what times will come, yet he may rejoyce, yea the worſe the times may be, the more cauſe may he have to rejoyce in his purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus being convinced that this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be done, that Truth is to bee bought, come wee now to ſhew how this duty is to be done, and wherein this buying ſtands.</p>
                  <p>This buying then ſtands in diverſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In giving a price, and paying a price for it. In trading in the world, when a man gives the price for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, he buyes it, and a man cannot be ſaid to have bought a commodity till ſome price be given for it, that is contracted for, <hi>ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. therefore in buying there is a price given. When <hi>Abraham</hi> bought the fields of <hi>Ephraim, he gave him the price of foure hundred ſhekels,</hi> and when hee gave that price then hee
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:150587:180"/> bought it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.6. <hi>ye ſhall buy meate of them that ye may eate, and ye ſhall buy water of them that ye may drinke.</hi> But how muſt they buy? yee ſhall buy meate of them <hi>for money,</hi> and ye ſhall buy water of them <hi>for money.</hi> That which a man hath without money, or ſome valuable conſideration; it is not bought, but is given freely, or taken unjuſtly. But when a man gives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for bread, gives money for water, then he buyes it. So in this caſe, hee that would buy Truth muſt give a price for it, it will not bee had for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that which a man hath for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is not bought. The price that men muſt give for Truth and Grace, is the uſe of all ſuch meanes by which Truth and Grace is to be gotten. So buy the Truth, that is, uſe all meanes by which it may bee had; God hath appointed certaine meanes in the uſe of which he will give Grace, and the knowledge of the Truth, and they that will have this commodity muſt give this price, muſt uſe ſuch meanes as God requires to be uſed to this end.</p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:150587:181"/>
                  <p>This price that God ſets is not a matter of money, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have bought that gift for money. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.18. <hi>He offred them money. But thy money periſh with thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to him. <hi>We our ſelves are bought with a price.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. but yet 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>are not redeemed with Silver, and Gold, and corruptible things,</hi> ſo Truth, and Grace muſt bee bought, but yet it is not gold that will buy this Gold. But there is another price with which Truth muſt bee bought. The uſe of thoſe meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that is the price; that look as by the giving of a price an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodity is bought, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo by the uſe of the meanes, Truth, and Grace is gotten, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And what then are thoſe meanes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Prayer, Buy the truth, pray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1,"/> for the knowledge of the truth, pray for grace. As by money wee obtaine and buy the commodity wee neede, and have a minde to, ſo by prayer wee obtaine and buy the truth. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you lacke wiſdome.</hi> Shop-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:150587:181"/> as men paſſe by their doores, aske them, What doe yee lacke? what is it that you want? So the Apoſtle here ſeemes to ſay, what is it that ye lackc? what is it that ye want? Doe yee want grace? Do ye want knowledge and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Well, what if we doe? How may wee come by it? <hi>Buy it,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle. I, but what is the price that muſt be given for it? If any man lacke wiſdome, ſtand in need of this commodity, <hi>let him aske of God.</hi> And it is the price that Chriſt ſets upon grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Aske and ye ſhall have.</hi> The price that the Lord ſets upon the knowledge of the truth. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. <hi>Call upon me, and I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and hidden things which thou knoweſt not.</hi> God highly befriends us, hee ſets the commodity at a low price. It is little worth that is not worth the asking. The way then to <hi>buy,</hi> is to <hi>beg; begging</hi> is <hi>buying,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> is <hi>paying.</hi> And therefore how often finde wee <hi>David</hi> in thoſe ſuites, <hi>Teach mee thy truth, teach me thy Statutes, &amp;c. David</hi> knew the commodity would not be bought without this price, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:150587:182"/> therefore hee ſtickes not at it, he gives the price, and ſeekes grace, and the knowledge of the truth by prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> hearing the Word, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> upon the Miniſtery thereof. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the circumciſion for the truth of God:</hi> So it may in another ſenſe be ſaid of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, That they are Miniſters of the Goſpel for the truth of God, to make knowne the truth of God, to offer and tender it unto people. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Law of truth was in Levi's mouth.</hi> God ſends them to ſet his truth to ſale, they bring this commodity to Market: So that if wee would buy the truth, wee muſt attend upon them whoſe worke is to diſpenſe the <hi>Word of truth,</hi> as the Goſpel is called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. And it is a part of the price that is to be given for it, to come to, &amp; attend upon their Miniſtery. See <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Law of truth was in his mouth,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>They ſhould ſeeke the Lawes (of truth) at his mouth.</hi> So then, they that would get
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:150587:182"/> the truth, muſt ſeeke it at the mouthes of Gods Miniſters, and that is the way to get this commodity. This is part of the price, to come to the publike meanes, and to attend upon them. <hi>Come and buy, Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is a part of buying. If <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes would buy Corne, they muſt not onely give money, but they muſt goe into Egypt, and their going into Egypt was one part of the price of it. They could not buy unleſſe they went into Egypt, where it was to be bought. They that will buy a commodity, they muſt goe to the Market, and the ſhops where the commodity is to be bought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Goe to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves.</hi> So if men would buy the truth, they muſt goe to them that ſell, and there buy. Now Gods Miniſters are they that in a good ſenſe ſell, and therefore to them, men muſt goe and buy. The Sabbaths are the Market dayes, the publike aſſemblies are the Market places, and the ſhoppes where this commodity is to bee bought. And if men would buy, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:150587:183"/> they muſt goe, there they muſt waite. And this going to, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the ordinance of preaching is a part of the price that muſt be given to buy this pearle. <hi>Buy the truth then,</hi> that is, goe to the Word, and attend upon the preaching of the Word, goe to the Market and waite upon that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> reading the Scripture, and other Bookes, that may helpe us to the knowledge of the truth, and build us up in grace, mutuall conference, and meditation. This is a price that muſt be given for truth. It is not enough to uſe publike helpes, but wee muſt uſe private helpes alſo, wee muſt trade and traffique in private, as well as in publike. Thus in the uſe of the meanes that God hath appointed, wee muſt buy this pearle of Truth and Grace. God can infuſe grace and knowledge into us without our endeavours in the uſe of the meanes, but God will not doe it. His way is that the meanes ſhall be uſed, and the uſe of the meanes is the price hee will have for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:150587:183"/> God gives grace, and the knowledge of the truth, as <hi>Boaz</hi> gave <hi>Ruth</hi> corne, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. Could not <hi>Boaz</hi> have given her at once as much corne as would have yeelded her <hi>an Ephah of Barley,</hi> and ſo have ſent her home without any more adoe? Yes ſurely, hee could have done it, and it had beene no more charge for him to have done ſo: But yet hee would have her uſe her endeavours, <hi>to gather and to gleane it, and beat it out to, when ſhe had gleaned it;</hi> and that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of hers ſhould bee the price ſhee ſhould pay for it. So God can give us knowledge by immediate revelation, and grace by immediate infuſion, but yet hee will have us uſe the meanes in praying, hearing, reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and our labour and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veavour in the uſe of thoſe meanes ſhall be the price with which the truth muſt be bought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in giving and paying the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>full</hi> price for it. A man that will buy a commodity, muſt not onely give a a price for it, but hee muſt give the <hi>full</hi>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:150587:184"/> price that is asked for it. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was to buy the field of <hi>Ephron, I will give thee money for it,</hi> and <hi>Ephron</hi> tells him <hi>it is worth foure hundred ſheck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els:</hi> Now if <hi>Abraham</hi> will buy it, hee muſt give him his price: And ſo hee did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.16. <hi>Hee weighed unto him the ſilver which hee had named,</hi> hee gave him the price which hee asked, and ſo bought the field. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him three hundred and fifty or three hundred and ninty ſheckels, hee had offered him a price, but not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrons</hi> price; hee had offered him ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but not the ſilver hee named; hee had offered a price, but not the <hi>full</hi> price; and ſo the bargaine had not beene ſtrucke thorow, the field had not beene bought. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.9. <hi>for as much money as it is worth,</hi> for <hi>full money,</hi> that is, as in the Hebrew, for the full price.</p>
                  <p>So it is here in the buying of the truth. Not onely muſt a price bee given, but a <hi>full</hi> price, Gods price that hee askes and ſets. I may allude to that ſpeech of Chriſts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.12. <hi>If yee
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:150587:184"/> thinke good, give me my price, and if not forbeare.</hi> So the Lord in this caſe ſaies to us, If yee thinke good of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity that I offer to you, yee ſhall have it, but then you muſt not thinke to have it at your owne price, but you muſt give me my price, the price that I aske and ſet you. The ſeller ſets one price, and the buyer offers another, but if the buyer offer too low a price, hee muſt riſe and come to the ſellers price if hee will have his commodity. It is not enough then if wee will buy the truth to offer a price, and give a price, but wee muſt give Gods price, that is, the <hi>full</hi> price. Now Gods price, the full price is this, it ſtands in theſe two things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> in an induſtrious, painefull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſerious uſe of meanes. The <hi>uſe</hi> of meanes is a <hi>price,</hi> but the <hi>full</hi> price is the <hi>ſerious, induſtrious</hi> uſe of the means, the uſing of the meanes with all our might, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Then ſhall wee know if wee follow on to know the Lord.</hi> Many pray, heare, reade, &amp;c. and yet buy not the truth, nor get knowledge, nor
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:150587:185"/> grace, they indeed give a price, but it is not Gods price, not the full price, and therefore they have not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. The Apoſtle ſayes of thoſe women, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. <hi>They were ever learning, and came not to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> They were cheapning and offering for it, but they never bought the truth, and all becauſe they came not to Gods price. There be ſome that are ever praying, ever hearing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reading, and yet never come to the knowledge of the truth, never get true grace. Heere indeede is a price given, meanes are uſed, but the full price is not given, meanes are not uſed in good earneſt, ſeriouſly, induſtriouſly with all their might. It is not enough to pray for grace and the truth, but men muſt pray ſo as God would have them pray, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you lacke wiſdome, let him aske of God, which giveth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> Well may one ſay, if that be all, I will ſoone aske it, I will give that price willingly for it. I, but marke verſe 6. <hi>But let him aske in faith:</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:150587:185"/> That teaches thus much; That asking is not enough, unleſſe men aske in that manner, for faith, and ſo for all other qualifications, as God requires. It muſt be faithfull, and fervent, earneſt prayer which is Gods price. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 5. <hi>If thou cryeſt and lifteſt up thy voyce, then, &amp;c.</hi> Hee ſayes not, If thou <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> that is to be done, that's part of the price, but if thou <hi>cryeſt.</hi> That's Gods price, to have fervent prayer, full of earneſtneſſe and contention of ſpirit. Cold, formall, dead-hearted prayer is not Gods price, it is too low a price to fetch ſo rich a commodity. What muſt I give you, ſay wee, when wee come to buy a commodity? So if wee would know here, <hi>My ſonne, give mee thine heart.</hi> In prayer for grace, give God thine heart. The tongue, the lippes, the voyce, is too low a price, God muſt bee prayed to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with the heart. Is that all? No, there is more yet; that ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.145. <hi>I cryed with my whole heart.</hi> That's the <hi>whole</hi> price, and <hi>full</hi> price in the point of prayer. Not ſome of the

                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:150587:187"/> heart, but the whole heart muſt bee given to God in this duty. It is not enough to heare the Word, to get grace and the truth, but men muſt ſo heare as God requires, with ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, with ſuch affection, with ſuch attention, with ſuch after endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as God commands. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.4. <hi>Sonne of man, behold with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and ſet thine heart upon all that I ſhall ſhew thee.</hi> Eyes and eares, and heart, muſt all be ſet on worke in the duty. Thoſe <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. heard the Word, but they gave not the full price, the price that God asked, <hi>Their hearts were running after their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe.</hi> It is not enough to reade, but it muſt be ſuch reading as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that will helpe a man to the truth, and to grace: It muſt be reading with induſtry, diligence, heedfulneſſe, and much paines-taking. Therefore Chriſt bids us not barely, <hi>Reade the Scriptures,</hi> but <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures.</hi> A man muſt ſet his head and his heart on worke both in reading the Word. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:150587:187"/> and ſearcheſt for her as for treaſures: Then ſhalt thou underſtand the feare of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God.</hi> There is the full price. What paines doe men take to ſeeke and ſearch for treaſures hid in the earth, for ſilver in the Mynes: They dig thorow rockes, dig wonderfull deepe, follow every veyne, and ſearch every cranny where the ſilver lyes; It coſts a great deale of paines and labour, in ſearching, and digging for ſilver; and ſo it muſt coſt a great deale of paines and induſtry in the reading of the Word and ſearching of the Scriptures, that's Gods full price in this particular, if we will buy the truth. Slight and overly formall uſe of theſe meanes, are not price e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to buy the truth.</p>
                  <p>If a man aske ten pounds for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and one bid him but tenne pence, hee cannot buy that commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The buyer and ſeller will never meete at ſuch a diſtance. God hee askes diligence, painfulneſſe, induſtry, and labour of ſpirit in the uſe of meanes: Now if wee come with our
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:150587:188"/> dead and cold formalities, and make prayer but a lip-labour, hearing but an eare-labour, reading but an eye-labor, this is to offer God but ten pence, nay but ten tokens, when hee ſets the price ten pounds: And they that come ſo ſhort of Gods price are never like to buy: God muſt have his full price, his whole price, and they are never like to buy that doe not give him his whole price, that offer him not halfe his price.</p>
                  <p>Here is that which keepes men off from buying, becauſe they are loth to goe to the full price, to bee at all that paines that muſt be taken in the uſe of the meanes. If prayer, hearing, reading, would doe it, they would not ſtick at that, but if ſo much paines and labour muſt bee taken in theſe, they thinke it too deare at ſuch prices &amp; rates, they will forbeare. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is too high for a foole.</hi> It is too high prizd in a fooles conceit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he buyes it not. The Wiſe-man ſpeakes in the fooles language, <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> in the plurall are too high. As
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:150587:188"/> if he had ſaid, fooles when they look upon this commodity of wiſedome, Oh ſay they, it is <hi>Wiſedomes,</hi> oh what a multitude is there of theſe truthes! what a deale of paines will it require to know all theſe things! and beſides, They be high points, deepe matters, what a deale of ſtudy, what beating of a mans braines will they aske, what a deale of ſtriving in prayer before wee ſhall attain to them! there is no med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them, as good goe without them, as take them at ſuch a deare price. And thus fooles loſe a good bargaine becauſe they thinke it too deare upon thoſe tearmes, becauſe they will not give the full price. It is otherwiſe with an underſtanding man, that underſtands the worth of Truth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.14. <hi>The heart of him that hath underſtanding ſeeketh knowledge.</hi> Hee ſeekes or purſues it. There bee many difficulties to be overcome, ere he can have it, it will coſt much paines, but he yet for all that ſeekes and purſues after it, hee ſtickes not at that price. And againe, <hi>The heart of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſeekes.</hi> Hee
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:150587:189"/> doth not onely <hi>ſpeake</hi> of it, or <hi>heare others ſpeake</hi> of it, but his <hi>heart,</hi> and his <hi>minde</hi> is upon it. And though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity be deare, yet if a man have a minde to it, he will have it though he pay the price. A man that hath an heart, and a minde ſeeking Truth, thogh the price of it be ſo much pains, labour and induſtry in the uſe of means yet he will buy it at that price, he will give the full price of it. So that when he bids us <hi>Buy the truth,</hi> hee bids us not onely <hi>pray,</hi> but <hi>pray hard, pray earneſtly with thy whole heart,</hi> not onely <hi>heare,</hi> but <hi>heare with all diligence, attention, and intention of ſpirit:</hi> not onely <hi>reade,</hi> but <hi>reade ſearchingly, diligently.</hi> This is Gods price, this is to give the <hi>full</hi> price.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in a cheerefull parting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with, and giving for the Truth ſuch things as are deare to us, or of price, and worth to us. Theſe may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to three heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1,"/> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> our luſts, and corruptions which are deare to us, which we count ſo dearely of as <hi>our right hands,</hi> and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:150587:189"/> 
                     <hi>our right eyes.</hi> And yet as deare as they be to us theſe muſt bee given, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with for the getting, and buying of the truth; Gods full price is that theſe muſt bee given, and bee all ſold, and made off to buy this purchaſe. So <hi>the merchant that findes the pearle of great price, Matth.</hi> 13.46. <hi>hee goes and ſells all that he had, and bought it.</hi> All that hee had was the full price of the pearle, and he came to the full price, parts with all that hee had, and ſo bought. Hee ſold not <hi>ſome</hi> of that he had, that was but a <hi>pinne</hi> of the price, not <hi>halfe</hi> that hee had, that was but <hi>halfe</hi> the price, but hee comes to the <hi>full</hi> price, <hi>All that hee had, and bought it.</hi> A man that will have Chriſt, and buy his Truth, muſt part with all his luſts, and give them all for this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Some man likes Chriſt and the Truth ſo well, that hee could bee content to part with this and that luſt, hee could as <hi>Herod, bee content to doe many things,</hi> and part with many things for the truth, but <hi>Herod</hi> hath one jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, his <hi>Herodias,</hi> hee is loath to buy
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:150587:190"/> truth ſo deare as to give her for it: It is too deare a price to buy truth at, to part with one ſo deare to him. I, but if <hi>Herod</hi> will have the truth, hee muſt come to Gods full price, not <hi>doing</hi> of <hi>many</hi> things, not the <hi>parting</hi> with <hi>ſome</hi> luſts and vanities, but the <hi>parting with all, Herodias</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> is Gods price. Bid wee, and offer wee what wee will, uſe meanes and endeavours, and goe on in them, yet if wee will not part with our luſts, we ſhall never have the bargaine, nor buy the pearle. It is a pearle of great price, and therefore a great price, the ſelling and putting off all our luſts, muſt be given for it, or elſe bid as oft and as faire as we will, it will not doe. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Ever learning, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> They bid faire for the truth. They were content to learne, and to bee at ſome paines to get the knowledge of the truth, which is more then a great many will bid for it, nay they doe it not for a fit, but are ever learning, they ſeeme to follow it with ſome cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and yet for all this never come to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:150587:190"/> the knowledge of the truth, ever bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but never come to buy the truth. Why? what's the matter they buy it not? Becauſe though they ſeeme to bid faire, yet they come not to the full price. They would ſell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to buy the pearle, but not ſell all, not part with their ſinfull luſts, and therefore God denyed them the knowledge of the truth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>They leade captive ſimple women laden with diverſe luſts,</hi> which women are <hi>ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth. Prov.</hi> 14.6. <hi>A ſcorner ſeeketh wiſdome, and findeth it not.</hi> Hee bids, and buyes not, hee will not give the full price, hee ſcornes at ſuch a deare price as to part with all his luſts. There is no reaſon or equity that the buyer ſhould have a mans commodity at the price hee will ſet: The ſeller is to ſet the price, and if hee cannot have his price, hee wrongs no man to keepe his commodity to himſelfe, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is richly worth the price hee ſets. If therefore wee would buy the truth, ſell away and part with all

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our money and meanes in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that kinde when God calls for it, theſe temporall things. It is true indeede that money will not buy grace: Indeed the Popes graces may be bought with money. There be Bookes in print of the taxes of the Apoſtolicall Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, in which bookes are ſold diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and abſolutions for all manner of villanies, and ſome not to be named. And, ſayes that Booke, theſe kinde of graces are not for the poore, becauſe they are deſtitute of goods and means. But therefore theſe graces are for the rich, they may for money buy the Popes graces: But Gods graces are not to be had for money. So <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would faine have been trading.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:150587:192"/> And yet in one ſenſe wee muſt buy the Truth with our money, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good; That is, wee ſhould bee willing to be at coſts and charges, and to ſpend money for the maintaining of thoſe meanes, and thoſe Ordinances in the uſe of which the truth is to bee gotten. Though we cannot buy grace for money, yet with our money wee may buy preaching, maintaine the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, we may buy Bibles, buy good Bookes, by all which wee may come to get the knowledge of the truth. And ſo in this ſenſe, wee muſt buy the truth with our money, and it is a part of Gods full price, and ſuch a price as muſt be given if men will buy the truth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. If need be part with <hi>any gettings to get the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though our money cannot buy grace, yet it can procure and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Miniſtery of the Word and preaching of the Goſpel, by which the knowledge of the truth and grace is to be gotten. And therefore it is well noted by ſome on that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. <hi>That the Merchant finding a rich
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:150587:193"/> treaſure hid in the field, is ſaid to ſell all and buy the field.</hi> He doth not buy the <hi>treaſure,</hi> but the <hi>field,</hi> and ſo in buying the field hee buyes the treaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The field is the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, in which the treaſure of grace is hid. And ſo ſome expound thoſe words, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; in which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome, and knowledge.</hi> Now though our money will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure grace and knowledge, yet it will purchaſe that field, the preaching of the Goſpel, in which theſe treaſures are to be had. And this price God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, a part of his full price, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Let him that is taught make him that teaches him partaker of all his goods.</hi> God will not have the Miniſtery of the Word eleemoſynary, to be matter of meere almes, but hee will have not onely mens <hi>paynes</hi> to heare the Word, but mens <hi>purſes</hi> to maintaine the Word, and his Ordinances, by which the truth is to be had. <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would not have the doores of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhut for nought, nor fire kindled upon
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:150587:193"/> his Altar for nought, Mal.</hi> 1.11. And would hee then have his Word open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for nought, and the fire of the word kindled for nought? No, but <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.8. <hi>Every one ſhall give of his Cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which hee inherites.</hi> And will have him that <hi>keepes the Fig-tree, eate of the fruit thereof, Prov.</hi> 27.18. and <hi>will have the Oxes mouth unmuzzeld that treads out the corne.</hi> So buy the truth, that is, be at coſt, and let your purſes walke for the maintaining of the Goſpell. Though our money cannot buy grace and knowledge of the truth, yet our money may buy Bibles, and good Bookes, by the reading whereof wee may come to get knowledge and grace So that when hee ſayes, <hi>Buy the truth,</hi> hee ſayes, <hi>Buy Bibles, buy good Bookes,</hi> and ſticke not at the coſt and charge of them, but willingly bee at ſuch charge for the getting of the truth. It was a great price thoſe Bookes came to which they burned after they came to the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. <hi>They brought their Bookes together,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:150587:194"/> and burned them before all men, and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thouſand peeces of ſilver.</hi> Surely they that in <hi>honour</hi> of the truth <hi>burned</hi> Bookes of ſo great price, would not have ſtucke in <hi>deſire</hi> of the truth to have <hi>bought</hi> Bookes of great price. And thus our fore-fathers, godly chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, before <hi>Luthers</hi> time here in <hi>England,</hi> when there was ſome glimpſe of the light of the Goſpel, they bought the truth, though at an high price. It is memorable which Mr. <hi>Foxe</hi> ſpeakes of them. They did ſit up whole nights in reading, and hearing good Bookes read. That was one part of the price they gave. But they did not onely buy with their <hi>paines,</hi> but with their <hi>purſes,</hi> with their <hi>goods,</hi> being at great coſt and expences in buying Bookes in Engliſh. They gave ſometimes five markes and more for a good Booke; they gave a loade of hay for a few chapters of Saint <hi>James,</hi> or Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in Engliſh. It was more money, five markes then, then ten pound is now. What a deale of coſt was it to buy
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:150587:194"/> ſuch bookes. I, but it was to buy the truth, and good men they thought truth deare at no price, nor the meanes of truth too high at any rate. It was Gods price then, and they ſhukt not at it. Thus is truth to be bought.</p>
                  <p>Buy the truth, lay out money and ſtick not at it, to maintaine preaching, to buy a Bible, &amp;c. Alas I want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I have ſo many occaſions, and the world ſo hard, I cannot be at the charge of maintaining preaching, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bibles, &amp;c. Thoſe be the ſhuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of earthly hearts, that are of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> minde, <hi>that the oyntment was waſted that was beſtowed upon Chriſt.</hi> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there be truth in it, yet I ſay buy the truth, and rather then not buy it, doe as our Saviour adviſes, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.36. <hi>He that hath no ſword, let him ſell his coat and buy one.</hi> So ſell thy coate, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Preacher, ſell thy coate, and buy a Bible: Thou muſt come to Gods price, if buy.</p>

                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:150587:196"/> Sometimes truth is at dearer rates then at other times. God ſometimes raiſes the price, that truth cannot be bought nor had but at theſe high rates, That if a man will have it, it may coſt him his deereſt comforts, his very blood and life it ſelfe. Truth was very deare, at very high prices in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. It pleaſed God that by the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up Queene <hi>Elizabeth, a nurſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Iſrael,</hi> that the prices fell, and truth was had at eaſier and lower rates. But yet when truth was at theſe deare prices in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, we ſee the ſervants of Chriſt did not ſticke to give the price of their blood for it: And though it were as much as their lives were worth to be medling with the Truth, and the Goſpel, yet they were content to come to Gods full price, to the very higheſt price of all, to part with all the comforts of this life, and life it ſelfe for the truth, when God pitched that price. And though it be ſometimes at lower prices, yet that is a price that muſt be pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wee muſt be willing to give it,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:150587:196"/> if God call for it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31, 32. <hi>Yee ſhall be my Diſciples, and yee ſhall know the truth.</hi> The knowledge then of the Truth, and being a Diſciple are both of a price. Looke what it will coſt to be a Diſciple, that it may coſt to get the truth. At what price then is it to be a Diſciple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him take up his croſſe and follow mee.</hi> So that hee that will bee a Diſciple muſt rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon upon the price of the Croſſe, and ſo muſt hee that will buy the truth, for a man muſt bee a Diſciple that will have the truth. I confeſſe this is a ſharp price when God calls for it, and yet this price muſt then be given. Wee ſaw before that it is a commodity royally worth what ever God askes for it. This men count too high a price and ſo ſtart at it that they let the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine goe. They deale juſt in this caſe as <hi>Boaz</hi> his kinſman did in the buying of <hi>Naomies</hi> land, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Hee ſaid, I will redeeme or buy it:</hi> I, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Boaz</hi> tells him of a condition that goes with the bargaine, <hi>What day thou buyeſt
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:150587:197"/> the field of the hand of Naomi, thou muſt alſo buy it of Ruth, &amp;c.</hi> thou muſt take her to wife, &amp;c. The man had a good minde to buy the field, but when hee heares of that condition, hee ſtarts at it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>by no meanes can I buy it, leſt I marre mine inheritance.</hi> So when truth is offered unto men to buy it; God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to ſell truth to you, ſay his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Buy it therefore, and let not ſuch a commodity goe. Oh ſay men, wee will buy it with all our hearts. I, but what day you buy the truth you muſt make account to take up the croſſe, make account of loſſe of liberty, &amp;c. when men heare that, and ſee the price ſo high, oh ſay they, wee cannot buy it, leſt wee marre our credit, our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, our houſes and lands, and our very lives. This price is thought too high, and thereupon men breake off. Thoſe in the parable, <hi>the ſtony ground,</hi> ſeemed to be very forward to buy the truth, <hi>but when perſecution and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes becauſe of the Word, they are offended,</hi> they ceaſe trading any longer, they like not the buying truth at ſuch
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:150587:197"/> ſmart rates as thoſe. If men might have the truth, and their credit, the truth and their peace, eaſe, liberties, they could be well content to buy it, but if it cannot be bought but upon ſuch hard termes, they will none, they will ſtay till it may bee had better cheape. And this is the ſecond thing in which is the full price of Truth, a willingneſſe for truths ſake to part with any thing that is deere and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third</hi> thing in which this buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſtands, is in paying current money for it. Hee that buyes a commodity, and comes with falſe coyne, hee doth not buy, but hee cheats: Hee is a cheater, not a chapman. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> bought the field of <hi>Ephron</hi> the Hittite, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.16. <hi>Hee weighed him foure hundred ſhekels of ſilver current money with the Merchant.</hi> So muſt God be dealt with all, men that will buy his commodity, and trade with him muſt pay him current money. Now money that is current, muſt <hi>firſt</hi> bee good mettall; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it muſt bee
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:150587:198"/> weight. If a man pay gold the mettall is currant, but if gold want weight, and be light, it will not paſſe, and proves not currant for want of weight. If money be weight, yet if it be not good mettall, be falſe and counterfeit coyne, be braſſe and copper, be gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or ſilver'd braſſe, that's not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: But when money is good for the materiall, is true ſilver and true gold, and when it is good for the weight, then it is currant money. And ſuch money muſt they buy withall that will buy truth, and will trade with God for this commodity. Now this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant money is not onely to <hi>uſe the meanes,</hi> and to uſe them <hi>with induſtry,</hi> but to uſe the meanes with <hi>induſtry in ſincerity, out of</hi> a love and <hi>with a love</hi> of the Truth for it ſelfe. To uſe meanes and uſe them induſtriouſly for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the truth, and not ſincerely out of a love of the truth, but for other ends, this is to offer copper, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit coyne, and God will not part with his commodity for ſuch coyne: Hee will not part with it but for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:150587:198"/> money: Hee will buy, and weigh every peece of our money, and when hee findes that men goe about to cheat him with falſe and counterfeit coyne, they ſhall none of his commodity. <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell thee to buy of me gold tryed in the fire.</hi> We muſt not thinke to buy gold with copper and braſſe, but men muſt give good gold for this gold if ever they meane to have it. As hee <hi>offers</hi> gold tryed in the fire, ſo hee <hi>requires</hi> gold tryed in the fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>To ſtir up your ſincere mindes, that yee may bee mindefull of the words, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo men muſt come with ſincere mindes, if they would underſtand the words of the Prophets, and come to the knowledge of the truth in the Scriptures. Yea, when men will be buying with falſe coyne, they ſhal not only not buy what they would have, but they ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and loſe what they ſeemed to have bought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12. that which hee had ſeemed to have bought. They ſhall miſſe of what they would buy, and they ſhall loſe what they have bought. And therefore <hi>David</hi> deſires
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:150587:199"/> of God that hee may have the Truth, and the knowledge of it, becauſe hee dealt honeſtly with him, paid him current money, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. <hi>With my whole heart,</hi> that is, with a ſingle and ſincere heart, <hi>have I ſought thee,</hi> and thy truth, <hi>Oh let mee not wander from thy Commandements,</hi> let mee not miſſe of the knowledge of thy Truth: Lord here is current money, let mee have the commodity. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered money for the gift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Hee is denyed it, becauſe he thought to buy it that way: But if hee had offered to buy it another way; hee ſhould have beene alſo denyed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Thine heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> Hee would have had that gift onely to have made an advantage of it, to have <hi>brought him in money,</hi> and therefore <hi>he offered money,</hi> therefore he deſired not that gift ſincerely for the gifts ſake. So when mens hearts are not right in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they uſe meanes, and take paines to get knowledge of the Truth, not for the love of the Truth, but for other by,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:150587:199"/> and baſe ends, that they may have credit or advantage by it, this is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer falſe coyne, and their heart is not right, and Gods Truth and Grace ſhall never be bought for falſe coyne: But when the meanes are uſed, uſed indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly and ſincerely, it is much to ſee how freely God will part with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to ſuch, ſincerity will bring in great encreaſes of the knowledge of the Truth, and all other graces. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him, Pſal.</hi> 25. When God ſees mens hearts ſincere in the ſeeking of the Truth, hee will liberally communicate his gifts and graces to them; nothing helpes a man to buy ſuch great penny worths as ſincerity doth: For as men, ſo God loves to trade and deale with ſuch as will deale honeſtly, and will be currant pay-maſters, will pay currant coyne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth</hi> thing in which this buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtands, is, <hi>To buy in time,</hi> and whilſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the commodity is to be had. A man that meanes to buy a commodity will take his time, and his ſeaſon, will be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:150587:200"/> ſure to be at the Market, and the faire, when the commodity is to be had. A man that meanes to buy, will not miſſe nor loſe the Market day, nor the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket time. Hee will make haſte to the market, and be ſure to take his time, becauſe if hee come too late the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity will be gone, and then he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy that hee wants. If a man come the day after the fayre, and the morrow after the market, hee may goe home as wiſe as hee came. Nay, if a man come to the market to buy, and walke up and downe, talke with this body, and that: If hee goe and ſit and talke away the market time in the Ale-houſe, bibbing, and twatling with this and that idle companion, before hee mindes it the market is over, and done, and hee cannot buy becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is all gone. Hee cannot buy becauſe through negligence and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hee loſt this market time. But hee that meanes to buy will doe that firſt, will waite upon his market time, will doe that buſineſſe firſt, and then if hee have any ſpare time, hee can ſpend it
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:150587:200"/> upon other leſſe neceſſary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So here, hee that will buy truth, muſt watch and take his market time, muſt be buying truth whileſt truth may be bought. There is a <hi>buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time,</hi> and a trading time for truth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under Heaven.</hi> And there is a time, and a ſeaſon, in which God offers Truth to bee ſold, in which men may buy it, and obtaine it, <hi>Luc.</hi> 19.42. <hi>If thou hadſt knowne, at leaſt in this thy day, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 44. <hi>Thou knoweſt not the day of thy viſitation. This thy day,</hi> that is, this market day, in which truth and grace might have beene bought. <hi>The time of thy viſitation,</hi> that is, the market time of Grace. There is then a <hi>day,</hi> and a <hi>time,</hi> a market day, and a market time, a day and time in which Grace and Truth are to be bought. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Wee then as workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, beſeech you that yee receive not the grace of God in vaine. For hee ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in the day of ſalvation have I
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:150587:201"/> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured thee: behold now the accepted time, behold now the day of ſalvation.</hi> Now then they that will buy the truth muſt be buying whileſt it is market time, muſt be trading for Truth and Grace whileſt they may be had, muſt ply their market whileſt the market laſts. <hi>To day if yee will heare his voyce. Luc.</hi> 12.56. <hi>Yee can diſcerne the face of the skie, how is it that yee doe not diſcerne this time?</hi> This buying time, this ſelling time, this market time. It muſt be a man care that will buy, to diſcern the buying time, and to lay hold upon that time, and to follow his market cloſe whileſt it laſts. If men will buy the truth, let them not neglect buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whileſt God offers to ſell, doe not trifle away the market time of Grace, in following the world, and thy luſts: Firſt make thy market, and when thy market is made, and thou haſt bought this commodity, that ſpare time thou haſt beſtow that upon ſecular buſineſſe of leſſe moment. A man that will buy the truth, when hee ſees it is market time, muſt doe as hee ſpeakes, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:150587:201"/> 16, 17. <hi>And all the ſilver and gold, &amp;c. That thou mayeſt buy ſpeedily with this money, bullockes, rammes, &amp;c.</hi> So when wee ſee it to be market time, and the good penny worths of the Goſpel are ſtirring, then all the time, all the paines, all the labour you can finde in all your courſe, offer it willingly as a price, that you may buy ſpeedily with your paines and diligence in the uſe of the meanes, knowledge of the truth, grace, and godlineſſe. When Chriſt bid <hi>Judas, That which thou doeſt, doe quickly,</hi> the Diſciples thought hee had meant, <hi>That thoſe things were neceſſary to be bought, hee ſhould buy quickly, Joh.</hi> 13.29. Surely ſo it muſt be in this caſe with all that will buy the Truth. That which yee doe, doe quickly: that which yee buy, buy quickly. So long as the Goſpel is preacht to us, ſo long it is market day, buying time: Therefore if yee will buy the Truth, now, now is the time, put it not off, I will buy to morrow, or next weeke, or next yeere, or at my lives end, but <hi>buy ſpeedily,</hi> and <hi>buy preſently:</hi> If yee
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:150587:202"/> loſe the market day, and market time, yee ſhall not then buy though yee would. The market may be done to morrow, the market may be paſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother yeere, and it will be too late to buy when the market is done. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9, 10. &amp;c. The fooliſh Virgins had their oyle to buy when they ſhould have had greateſt uſe of it. It was no time to goe to buy oyle when the Bridegroome was come, it was too late then, whileſt they goe to buy then, and furniſh themſelves, then the Bridegroome comes, and they are ſhut out of doores. Had they bought their oyle when the time of buying was, then they had entred. Preſſe men to get grace, the knowledge of the truth, to be trading now whileſt the market time of the Goſpel, and their life laſts; and their anſwer is, all in good time, hereafter may ſerve, at the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt at their death. I, but then it is no buying time. Alas, it is an ill time to be catechiſed in, and to be learning the knowledge of the Truth when a man is upon his death bed. That's the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:150587:202"/> time to <hi>ſpend oyle,</hi> not to <hi>buy oyle.</hi> It is then <hi>dying</hi> time, not <hi>buying</hi> time, it is ill <hi>buying</hi> when a man is <hi>dying.</hi> If a man be to buy then, the doore of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be ſhut upon him before hee can returne from the ſhops. In vaine ſhall men ſeeke the truth, and grace, and to be taught when the day of grace is paſt, that would not take and buy it whileſt the market of the preaching of the Goſpel was on foot. See <hi>Joh</hi> 8.21. When the market is done, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then <hi>yee ſhall ſeeke</hi> to buy, and all the world if yee had it, yee would give to buy the Truth, and ye ſhall not buy <hi>but yee ſhall dye, and dye in your ſinnes.</hi> It is not in the markets of the Goſpel as it is with other markets. Wee ſee many will put off buying in other markets, till toward the end of the market, till men have ſome commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lye upon their hands, and there be but few left to buy, and then they make account at the latter end of the market to buy at lower prices, to get better penny-worths: And ſo it oft proves. But it will not prove ſo here,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:150587:203"/> the beſt penny-worths here are to be had at the beginning of the market. At the end of the market it is a great venture if any thing will be to bee bought at all, or if it be to be bought, it cannot be had but at farre dearer prices then it might before. If thou doe get any thing it will coſt thee dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and trebble the price it might have beene had for in the prime of the market. If thou get any grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at thy death, that haſt neglected it in thy life time, and in the time of grace, it muſt be had with farre more ſtruggling, ſorrowing, weeping, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, repenting, then it might have beene had for before. God is ever deerer, and his prices higher at the latter end of the market, then at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                  <p>When God offers this commodity to buy, they ſhuffle it off, <hi>they have farmes to buy, yoakes of Oxen to buy, Luc.</hi> 14. they have ſo many things to buy, that they will not buy the Truth, <hi>I pray thee have mee excuſed,</hi> I muſt lay out my time and paines for other things, I have not wherewith to buy this Truth. It is miſerable to ſee how cold mens deſires are after the Truth. Juſt as <hi>Pilate, Joh.</hi> 18.38. <hi>What is Truth?</hi> A good queſtion, but asked with a baſe oſcitancy of ſpirit, hee cares not to know what Truth is, but before an anſwer can be given <hi>hee goes his way out,</hi> and turnes his backe upon
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:150587:205"/> Chriſt. Juſt ſuch reſpect give me not the Truth. Preſſe them to buy the Truth. Why, what (ſay they) is truth? but they care not ſo much as to heare what the Truth is, they ought to buy.</p>
                  <p>Some it may be could be content to buy it, ſo it might be at their owne price, if now and then a Sermon, a Chapter, reading a good Booke in a good fit, would helpe them to it, they would not greatly ſticke at it. But as <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.12, 13. <hi>They weighed for my price thirty pieces of ſilver. And the Lord ſaid caſt it to the Potter, a goodly price that I was prized at of them:</hi> So a goodly price that Truth is prized at of men, as if God offered <hi>traſh,</hi> when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers <hi>Truth.</hi> The Devils co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities goe off roundly, men will buy their luſts, though it coſt them the price of their ſoule, and men will buy toyes, buy Play-bookes, ballads, Dice, Cards, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> theſe commodities hang not, but Gods market is at a ſtand. For ſhame be awakened to this duty, and now that God offers to deale with us, let us
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:150587:206"/> fall to buying. Conſider but two things to quicken us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a commodity that is like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to grow deere, it is a commodity that may riſe, and may be that it will bee very hard to be had. See how the world went in <hi>Elies</hi> time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>And the Word of the Lord was precious in thoſe dayes there was no open viſion.</hi> The Truth roſe to an high price, no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prophecying. Wee have no char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the perpetuity of the Truthes abiding with us. What know wee but it may grow as precious, to as deere and high prices as it did in <hi>Elies</hi> dayes? There is a time <hi>when running to and fro will increaſe knowledge,</hi> and helpe to buy the truth, paines are to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. And there is a time <hi>when running to and fro will doe no good,</hi> when for no price nor paines Truth will be had, <hi>Am.</hi> 8.12. And who knowes but hee may ſee ſuch dayes? And is it not better to runne to and fro, to take paines when good will be done upon it, then to runne to and fro, when all the paines in the world will
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:150587:206"/> not helpe us to this bargaine? Wee ſee how deere, extraordinary deere one kinde of graine is now with us. Had a man foreſeene it a yeere before, what a deale might hee have ſaved, and gained by buying good ſtore of that graine then! When <hi>Joſeph</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the ſeven yeeres famine in Egypt, it was his wiſedome and providence to buy all the Corne that ever hee could lay his hands on, and what a world of advantage did it bring in to the King of Egypt! If hee had ſtayed buying till the famine came, hee could have had Corne for no money, none was to be had, and Egypt had ſtarved for it. So wiſely he did to buy Corne whileſt Corne was plentifull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Buying the truth will keep the Truth and the Goſpel amongſt us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but if wee neglect and ſlight the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it will be the loſſe of the Goſpel, and all the good wee have with it. Wee ſee a man that comes to market ſo long as men buy up his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and hee hath ſtore of cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, he keepes the market conſtantly,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:150587:207"/> and will not leave comming to the market: But if once his takings faile, and men ceaſe to buy, hee may come a while ſtill to try if his markets will mend, but if hee ſees they mend not, and men buy not, hee goes quite away and carries his commodities to ſome other place, where hee may finde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trading. Juſt ſo here: Buying will keepe God and the Goſpel with us, keepe the market going, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel will never goe; but once ſlight Gods Truth, and regard not the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his commodity, God will packe up and be gone, and try a new place for trading. <hi>Hee caſt thoſe out of the Temple that bought and ſold, Luc.</hi> 19. hee caſt them out for trading in the Temple, but here hee will caſt men out of the Temple, will unchurch them, will take away Church and Goſpel, becauſe men doe not buy in the Temple. If ever yee loſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Truth, bee aſſured that yee loſe it becauſe yee make no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of buying the truth. Yee ſee many places that were great market
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:150587:207"/> Townes, that now their market is downe and quite decayed. Why ſo? becauſe men come not in to ſell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. And why came they not in to ſell? Becauſe men came not in to buy. So here: If wee will not buy the Truth, God will take his Truth away, our markets ſhall downe, and God will carry his Truth to Turkes, Indians, Jewes, and there God will have great and goodly markets. God will not ſtay long where once markets grow dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the prohibition followes, <hi>Sell it not.</hi> When once thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the truth, and gotten grace, by no meanes part with it againe, but hold and keepe it faſt. In ſelling there is a parting with that, wherein we have a propriety, and wherein wee have a poſſeſſion. In ſelling there is an alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our right, propriety, and poſſeſſion of the commodity ſold, ſo upon the ſale of my commodity, I part with it, it is no more mine, I have no more to doe with it, my commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and I are wholly parted. And
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:150587:208"/> thus hee prohibits the ſelling of the truth. Doe not ſell it when once thou haſt it, part not with Truth, Grace, Religion upon any tearmes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not with this, as with other worldly commodities. Other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities a man may buy, and may ſell againe.

I, but it muſt not be ſo with the Truth, <hi>The Truth which dwells in us, and ſhall be with us for ever.</hi> Truth
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:150587:209"/> once bought muſt be bought for ever, muſt never be ſold more nor parted with. It is with Truth as it was with the Land of <hi>Canaan, Levit.</hi> 25.23. <hi>The Land ſhall not be ſold for ever, or to be quite cut off.</hi> As that which a man ſells hee ſells for ever, and a man quite cuts off all future claime and right to it.

All they might doe was but a kinde of leaſe, which muſt determine too at the yeere of Jubile. It is mine ſayes the Lord, therefore muſt not be ſold. And ſo, the Truth muſt not be ſold, no not leaſed out neither. The Jewes might ſell their land for a time, but not for ever. But the truth may not be ſold though but for a time, a little time. The Land ſhall not be ſold <hi>for ever.</hi> The truth muſt not be ſold <hi>at all, Apoc.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Behold I come quickly, hold faſt that which thou haſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Hold faſt that which is good.

Some ſell the truth for a Benefice, for a good Looke, for a little good opinion.

See <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>All the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her. Job</hi> 28.16, 17, 18. <hi>It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious Onix, or the Saphire. The gold and the Chrystall cannot equall it: and the exchange of it ſhall not be for fine gold. No mention ſhal be made of Corall, or of pearles: for the price of wiſdome is above Rubies.</hi> Houſes lands, liberty, wife, children, life it ſelfe, they are all too cheape, too low a price to take for Truth, and to part with Truth for. It may be by ſelling the truth, and parting with it, thou haſt got preferment, and it may bee when thou haſt ſold the truth upon ſuch termes thou art ready to bleſſe thy ſelfe, and to ſay as they did that ſold their flockes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.5. <hi>They that ſell them ſay, Bleſſed be God for I am rich.</hi> It may be thou groweſt rich by ſelling the Truth, haſt gotten ſuch preferment, and promotion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:150587:212"/> of thy falling from the Truth &amp; Religion. It may be thou haſt gotten liberty out of trouble and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, haſt ſaved thy lands and thy life, by the ſale and forſaking of the Truth, and thou thinkeſt thou haſt ſold it well, to get and ſave all this by it. As well as thou haſt got, thou haſt made a fooles bargaine, thou haſt ſold it for trifles, thou haſt not gotten the tenth part of the price Truth is worth. <hi>Eſau ſold his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage.</hi> All thou haſt gotten, bee it what it will, is but as a meſſe of pottage to a precious jewell. If a man will ſell the Truth, let him ſell it and ſpare not, if hee can ſell it for that which is better then it, nay if hee can ſell it but for that which is but as good as it: But inaſmuch as there is nothing in this world that can come neere the worth of it, it is a childiſh, and a fooliſh thing to part with it. If a man have a minde to ſell his houſe and land, yet if when hee hath offered it to ſell hee cannot get the worth of it, but if hee ſell it, hee muſt part with it upon low termes
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:150587:213"/> muſt take an hundred pounds for that which is worth a thouſand, hee will rather keepe it ſtill, and never ſell it rather then ſell it ſo under foot, then ſell it ſo as all the world ſhall laugh at him for a foole and a ſilly fellow: So here, if the world can give thee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worth of Truth, ſell it, and put it off, and ſpare not; but inaſmuch as the world cannot give thee the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of the worth of it, ſell it not, but keepe it ſtill rather then make a fooles bargaine, and to be made the laughing ſtocke of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> to ſell the Truth, it is to make a profane bargaine, and it is a manifeſt evidence of a profane heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Looke diligently leaſt any man fall from the grace of God,</hi> that is, leſt any man ſell the Truth, they are the ſame thing. What if any man doe ſell the truth, and fall from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace? <hi>Leſt there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſon as Eſau was, who for one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of meat ſold his birth-rights.</hi> Marke then, that that man that ſells the truth
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:150587:213"/> and falls off from it, is ſuch another profane perſon as <hi>Eſau</hi> was, and is guilty of the ſame profaneneſſe that he was. <hi>Eſaus</hi> profaneneſſe what was it? not onely in this that hee ſold ſuch a priviledge at ſo deſpicable a price (that indeed aggravates his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe) but in that hee ſold ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things for temporall things. The ſelling of his birth-right was the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his title to, and hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This to doe is profaneneſſe, and this they doe that ſell the Truth for eaſe, preferment, liberty, life, &amp;c. They ſell ſpirituall things for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ones; they ſell their right to, and hope of Heaven for outward things. And thus are they guilty of making a profane bargaine. Thou that ſelleſt the Truth thou makeſt <hi>Eſaus</hi> bargaine, and ſheweſt thy ſelfe as profane a wretch as <hi>Eſau</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to ſell the Truth, it is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> make a dangerous bargaine, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Let not him that ſelleth mourne,</hi> but no man hath more cauſe to mourne then he that ſells the Truth, that man
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:150587:214"/> may come home by weeping croſſe. That as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes in that caſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Hee that with-holdeth Corne, the people ſhall curſe him: but bleſsing ſhall be upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> So here contrarily. Hee that holds, and keepes faſt the truth, God himſelfe ſhall bleſſe him, but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhall be upon the head of him that ſells it. It is that which will bring a curſe with it, and therefore a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſale. Dangerous in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as doe make Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of the truth, and ſell it, and once part with it, they ſeldome or never recover it againe. That's Gods curſe upon them for ſelling, that they ſhall never redeeme or buy it more. A man that ſells his inheritance, it is ſeldome ſeene that ever hee comes to buy it againe. And yet it is poſſible, and falls out oft in the World, that a man ſells his houſe and Land, and lives to redeeme and buy it againe: But when a man hath ſold the truth, &amp; hath play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voluntary <hi>Apoſtata</hi> by falling
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:150587:214"/> from Religion; whoſe experience can give an example of any one that ever recovered againe, and repented, and received, and embraced the truth againe. That's commonly Gods curſe upon ſuch, ſince yee have ſold it, yee ſhall ſell it for ever, you ſhall never have the commodity againe. That as in that ſenſe the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Eze.</hi> 7.13. <hi>The ſeller ſhall not returne to that which is ſold:</hi> So in this caſe, God in wrath makes it good upon the ſellers of the Truth, ſuch ſellers ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to that which they have ſold, but as they have parted with the truth, ſo they and the truth ſhall be parted for ever. They are irreducible, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by the Miniſtery of the Word, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.7. <hi>And my people are bent to backe-ſliding from mee; though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as ſell the Truth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God will ſell them, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall be ſold: And that,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ſhall be ſold over to ſinne, ſold to be bond ſlaves and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:150587:215"/> to all wickedneſſe. That as it is ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Hee did ſell himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> There was none like unto him: So it is true often of the ſellers of the Truth, that when men have once bought the Truth and then ſell it againe, they have once profeſt the Truth and Religon, and then decline, and fall off, they grow ſo wicked, ſo vile, ſo baſe in their courſes, that there are none like them, they be men ſold over to ſinne, to commit wickedneſſe with greedineſſe. <hi>The houſe fell,</hi> ſayes <hi>Chriſt, and the fall of that houſe was great. If theſe men,</hi> ſayes <hi>Moſes dye the common death of men, &amp;c.</hi> So theſe men fall not the common falls, ſinne not the common ſinnes of men, but prove the moſt tranſcendent, outragious ſinners of all other men. None ſo looſe, none ſo notorious drunkards, adulterers, non ſo bitter and peſtilent perſecutors of the Truth as they. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.30. <hi>There were forſakers of the Covenant,</hi> ſellers of the Truth, and what proved they, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>wicked doers againſt the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:150587:215"/> Covenant. Pſal.</hi> 53.3. <hi>Every one of them is gone backe,</hi> back from the truth, were ſellers of the truth. And what proved they? <hi>they are altogether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come filthy.</hi> They prove filthy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, filthy drunkards, filthy adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, filthy ſcoffers, filthy perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Thus men that have ſold the Truth, are ſold to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of God and men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> they ſhall be ſold over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hand and power of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. When men ſell Truth, they ſell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God, and when men ſell God, God will ſell them, and as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.12. <hi>Thou ſellest thy people for nought.</hi> We ſhall never finde God threatning to ſell his people, or ſelling them, but when they had firſt ſold the Truth. Hee threatens to ſell them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.6, 8. <hi>There yee ſhall be ſold unto your enemies for bond-men and bond-women.</hi> But this threatning is upon their forſaking God, and his truth, and the purity of Religion, and their falling off to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry. And when hee did ſell them, why was it? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:150587:216"/> they had firſt ſold the Truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.30, 32. <hi>How ſhould one chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight, except their rocke had ſold them, and the Lord had ſhut them up? For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their cluſters are bitter.</hi> And ſo <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>And the children of Iſrael did evill in the ſight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and ſerved Balaaim, and the groves. Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot againſt Iſrael, and hee ſold them into the hand of Cuſhan-Riſhathaim King of Meſopotamia: and the children of Iſrael ſerved Cuſhan-Riſhathaim eight yeeres.</hi> And <hi>Judg.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>And the children of Iſrael againe did evill in the ſight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead. And the Lord ſold them into the hand of Jabin King of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor, the Captaine of whoſe hoſt was Siſera which dwelt in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſheth of the Gentiles.</hi> It is an hainous thing <hi>to ſell a righteous man for ſilver, the poore for a paire of ſhooes, Am.</hi> 2.6. And that which brings heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:150587:216"/> upon a Nation, how much more will it bring heavie judgement upon a Nation when they ſell God, and they that ſell truth ſell God. See how God threaens <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon, Joel</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. <hi>The children alſo of Judah, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Jeruſalem have ye ſold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. Behold I will raiſe them out of the place whither ye have ſold them, and will returne your recompence upon your owne head. And I will ſell your ſonnes and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they ſhall ſell them to the Sabeans, to a people farre off, for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> It was an hainous ſinne to ſell the children of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> God would be quit with them for it. And how heinous is it then to ſell truth which is the Daughter of God? Surely when men doe ſell truth, and a Nation doth apoſtatize from God, God will be quit with them, hee will ſell them into the hands of their enemies, they and their children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſuch as ſell the truth ſell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:150587:217"/> their owne ſoules. Get what yee can by ſelling the truth, yet <hi>what ſhall a man give in exchange for his owne ſoule.</hi> What if by ſelling the truth a man could gaine the whole world, yet <hi>what ſhall it advantage a man to gaine the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule.</hi> It is ill ſelling when a man ſhall ſell to loſſe, but ſpecially it is ill ſelling when a man ſhall loſe his owne ſoule by the bargaine. Hee loſes his ſoule that ſells it, hee ſells it that ſells the truth. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.8. <hi>He that getteth wiſdome,</hi> that buyes the truth, <hi>loves his owne ſoule.</hi> I, but a man may buy truth and ſell it away againe, may get wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and loſe it. And what then is his ſoule the better for it? Therefore marke what followes, <hi>He that keepes underſtanding ſhall finde good:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Hee that gets wiſdome, and keepes it, hee that buyes truth, and ſells it not, hee loves his owne ſoule, hee ſaves his owne ſoule: therefore hee that gets it, and keepes it not, that buyes it and ſells it againe, hee hates his owne ſoule, hee loſes, hee damnes
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:150587:217"/> his owne ſoule. <hi>Iudas</hi> hee ſold Chriſt for thirty peeces, it was the deereſt bargaine that ever man made, in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt, hee ſold his owne ſoule, hee damned his owne ſoule by that ſale. It is the caſe of every man that ſells truth, hee that ſells truth, <hi>Iudas</hi>-like hee ſells Chriſt, and <hi>Iudas</hi>-like hee loſes his owne ſoule. It was death by Law to ſell ſome things, as <hi>to ſteal a man and ſell him, Exod.</hi> 21.16. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.7. And it is death, eternal death to ſell the truth. They that ſell the truth, ſel God, ſell Chriſt, and ſo ſell their ſouls. They ſell Heaven, and buy Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may a man keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from ſelling the truth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> get the love of the truth into thine heart. That man that loves the truth wil never ſell the truth, and the truth is never ſold but it is ſold for ſomething that is loved better than the truth. A man that ſells it for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and gaine, loves gaine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment better then the truth, that ſells it for life or liberty, loves theſe better then truth. Now let a man learne to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:150587:218"/> love the truth better than all worldly things, and hee will never ſell it for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.127. <hi>I love thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements above gold, yea above fine gold.</hi> Therefore to be ſure hee would rather ſell gold for truth, then truth for gold. Therefore they ſold the truth, and <hi>beleeved lyes,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received not the truth in love.</hi> A man that is in love with his houſe, with his land, no price will tempt him to ſell it. If a man have but an horſe that hee loves, though hee be offered more then hee can be worth, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee loves him, hee will not part with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Say unto wiſdome, Thou art my ſiſter, and call underſtanding thy kinſwoman.</hi> A man will not ſell his ſiſter becauſe hee loves her. Say in in this caſe, as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Wee after our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Iewes, which were ſold unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; and will you even ſell your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> Our fore-fathers, the Martyrs, after their ability bought the truth, and gave their lives to buy and redeem
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:150587:218"/> the truth, and we wil even ſell the truth which ſhould be as deere to us as our brethren, as our ſiſters?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> take heed, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of ſelling Truthes of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are not ſo fundamentall, and ſo neceſſary: Be not over eaſie to part with them. Hee that will over eaſily part with ſmaller truthes, is in a dangerous preparation to ſell maine and ſubſtantiall Truthes. Hee that will not be brought to ſell ſome ſmall field, that lyeth far off from his houſe, hee will never be brought to ſell all his whole inheritance. But when men begin once to ſell here a peice, and there a piece, it comes to paſſe at laſt that the whole followes after, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and manſion houſe goes, and is ſold at laſt: Hee that will ſell and part with little truthes, and not ſticke cloſe to them, hee will if neede be ſit as looſe from maine fundamentall Truthes.</p>
