            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the 16.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150587:11"/> and favour. For it is a Å¿ure thing that a ChriÅ¿tian Å¿o demeaning himÅ¿elfe as his rule guides him, may live the moÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life of any man in the world. <hi>He may keepe a continuall feaÅ¿t,</hi> and a <hi>feaÅ¿t</hi> is made <hi>for laughter, Eccl.</hi> 10.

                  </p>
                  <p>If it be not Å¿o with a ChriÅ¿tian, it is moÅ¿t what his owne fault, and comes from Å¿ome fayling and miÅ¿carriage in himÅ¿elfe, that hee doth not that which he Å¿hould, to maintaine his heart in this happie frame. The ApoÅ¿tle therefore having adviÅ¿ed hereto he layes downe Å¿ome rules and meanes in certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, for the procuring and preÅ¿erving of this <hi>Å¿pirituall joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The FirÅ¿t <hi>Precept,</hi> verÅ¿. 17. <hi>pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> He that would <hi>rejoyce continually,</hi> muÅ¿t <hi>pray continually,</hi> he that would <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore,</hi> muÅ¿t <hi>pray evermore.</hi> As is our conÅ¿cience of, and conÅ¿tancy in the duty of prayer: Å¿uch is the conÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

                  <p n="2">2. The Å¿econd <hi>Precept</hi> is this, verÅ¿. 18. <hi>In al things give thankes,</hi> He that would <hi>rejoyce</hi> in all eÅ¿tates and conditions muÅ¿t be <hi>thankefull</hi> in all eÅ¿tates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He that would <hi>rejoyce</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

The way to keep ones Å¿elf warme, is to keepe the fire burning. It is a fond thing for a man to quench his fire, and then thinke to keepe himÅ¿elfe Å¿till warme. It is no wonder that this man complaines of cold, that hath let his fire goe out, or hath himÅ¿elfe quench'd, and extinguiÅ¿ht it. And thus we have the coherence of theÅ¿e words with the former.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150587:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Now for the words, <hi>Quench not the Å¿pirit.</hi> In them there is a Metaphor, and a Metonymie. The metaphor in the word <hi>Quench:</hi> Quenching properly is of fire, when the light and heate of fire is abated and put out, wee uÅ¿e to Å¿ay it is quenched. And hence is this word borrowed to Å¿ignifie the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, decaying, or extinguiÅ¿hing of the <hi>Å¿pirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Metonymie is in the word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Spirit</hi> is taken</p>
                  <p n="1">I. For the eÅ¿Å¿ence of the Deity. So <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> It is not Å¿o ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, It is taken for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Å¿anctification, for the Å¿anctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts of the Å¿pirit. And therefore it is that the name of the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> is given to diverÅ¿e graces, as <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 11.2. The <hi>Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneÅ¿Å¿e, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Å¿pirit of faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And the Å¿pirit of love,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. that is, the gift of meekneÅ¿Å¿e, faith, love, infuÅ¿ed by the Holy GhoÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning theÅ¿e <hi>graces of Å¿anctification,</hi> we muÅ¿t remember two DiÅ¿tinctions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DiÅ¿tinct.</hi> 1. Some Å¿anctifying graces are radicall, originall, fundamentall graces, primary graces as they may be called, which are the immediate worke of the <hi>Å¿pirit,</hi> as faith, hope, love: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are Å¿econdary graces iÅ¿Å¿uing and flowing from theÅ¿e, which though the Spirit workes too, yet it workes by theÅ¿e: Å¿uch is joy which ariÅ¿es from faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Fill your hearts with joy in all beleeving:</hi> Å¿uch is confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ing from hope; Å¿uch is zeale and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150587:13"/> fervour of Å¿pirit ariÅ¿ing from love. TheÅ¿e are, as it were, the luÅ¿tre, the Å¿hine, the radiancy of the radicall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall graces. They are the flame of them. There is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the coales of fire that lye on the harth, and the flame of the fire which is kindled from the coals on the harth. When a mans faith cauÅ¿es joy, then faith flames; when his hope breedes confidence, then hope flames; and when a mans love makes him zealous, then his love flames, and burnes out. They are like the body of the Sunne, and the beames of the Sunne; Faith, Hope, Love, they the <hi>body;</hi> Joy, Confidence, Zeale, they the <hi>beames</hi> of the Sunne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>DiÅ¿tinct.</hi> Wee muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider in the Å¿anctifying graces of the Spirit 3. things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. There are the gifts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, the habits infuÅ¿ed, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of faith, hope, and love.</item>
                     <item>2. There is the uÅ¿e and exerciÅ¿e and act of them.</item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:150587:14"/>
                     <item>3. There are the degrees, and Å¿everall meaÅ¿ures of them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God Å¿ignifies the <hi>motions</hi> and holy <hi>Å¿uggeÅ¿tions</hi> of the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thoÅ¿e gracious excitements to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>The Spirit blowes where it liÅ¿teth.</hi> The motions of the Å¿pirit are the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and the blaÅ¿ts of it. And this is alÅ¿o here meant. Now Å¿eeing what <hi>Spirit</hi> Å¿ignifies, we are to inquire in what Å¿enÅ¿e, and after what Å¿ort the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be <hi>quenched. Quenched</hi> it may be, or elÅ¿e the counÅ¿ell is in vaine, not to <hi>quench</hi> it. And againe, if it may be quenched, it may be an uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing; what comfort can a man have in having Gods Spirit, if it may be loÅ¿t? what comfort to have this fire kindled in our hearts, if Å¿o be it be a quenchable fire. Therefore for the clearing of this point, wee muÅ¿t know:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. FirÅ¿t, take the Spirit for the Å¿pirit of prophecie; that may be <hi>quencht</hi> and loÅ¿t: and Å¿o for the gifts of government, MiniÅ¿tery, &amp;c. This Spirit may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150587:14"/> quenched. A man may have Å¿uch gifts much decayed and abated, yea a man may wholly loÅ¿e Å¿uch gifts. As it is Å¿aid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>the Å¿pirit of the Lord came upon him;</hi> Å¿o it is Å¿aid of him, that <hi>ihe Spirit of the Lord departed from him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take the Spirit for the gifts &amp; common graces of illumination; and Å¿o the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> may be quencht, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguiÅ¿hed, Å¿o as Å¿uch may quite loÅ¿e that grace that look'd like grace, and came very neere a Å¿aving grace. <hi>If they fall away,</hi> Heb. 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men may have all that there is Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of which fall away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take the Spirit for the Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit, and then make uÅ¿e of this firÅ¿t diÅ¿tinction. And according to it, the radicall and fundamentall graces of the <hi>Å¿pirit,</hi> Å¿uch as faith, hope, love, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wholly &amp; totally extinguiÅ¿hed, where once they are wrought in the heart, but yet their luÅ¿tre, their radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancie, their Å¿hine, and flame may bee quenched. A man though he cannot loÅ¿e his faith, yet he may loÅ¿e and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150587:15"/> want, and quench his joy. A man, though he cannot loÅ¿e his hope, yet may loÅ¿e his comfort, and confidence. A man, though he cannot loÅ¿e his love, yet may coole his zeale and fervour: Wee Å¿ee in a fire, the wood may bee burnt out, and Å¿o the flame abated, and quite quenched; but yet there remains Å¿till an heap of coales on the harth, and there may be a good fire Å¿till, though the flame be quenched. The beames of the Sunne doe not alwayes Å¿hine out; a cloud may be interpoÅ¿ed that may intercept the beames of the Sun, and the bright and comfortable radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Å¿plendour of them: but yet the body of the Sunne is in heaven Å¿till, though the beames be intercepted: So joy, confidence, zeale, may for a time be quenched, loÅ¿t abated, but though the flame of theÅ¿e be downe, and the beames of theÅ¿e be hindred, yet there are coales of fire in the heart, and the body of theÅ¿e is there. The flame of the Å¿pirit, the feeling &amp; Å¿enÅ¿e of it may be quenched for a time in the Å¿econda-graces thereof, but yet the Å¿pirit it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150587:15"/> Å¿elfe, and the cardinall graces thereof remaine Å¿till in the heart. It may bee in this, as in that caÅ¿e, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 6.13. As a Teyle Tree, <hi>and as an Oake, whoÅ¿e Å¿ubÅ¿tance is in them, when they cast their leaves.</hi> An Oake may be greene and flouriÅ¿hing all the Summer, but when Winter comes, it caÅ¿ts and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth the leaves, but yet when the leaves are gone, the life is not gone, the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance and the Å¿ap is in it Å¿till, though the leafe be gone. Faith, Hope, Love, theÅ¿e are the <hi>Å¿ap</hi> and <hi>Å¿ubÅ¿tance</hi> of a ChriÅ¿tian; joy, confidence, zeale, theÅ¿e are his <hi>leaves.</hi> There may come a Winter, when a ChriÅ¿tian may caÅ¿t his leaves, may loÅ¿e his joy, &amp;c. but yet even then his Å¿ubÅ¿tance and his Å¿ap of faith, hope, and love is in him. It is one thing to loÅ¿e <hi>life,</hi> another thing to loÅ¿e a <hi>leafe.</hi> A ChriÅ¿tian may be a Teyle Tree, or an Oke without a <hi>leafe,</hi> but not without <hi>life.</hi> This we Å¿hall Å¿ee plaine in <hi>Davids</hi> caÅ¿e, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 51.11, 12. <hi>Take not away thine holy Å¿pirit from me, ReÅ¿tore to me the joy Å¿alvation.</hi> It is cleer therefore that though <hi>David</hi> had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150587:16"/> the joy of the Å¿pirit quenched, yet the Å¿pirit Å¿till unquenched: The Å¿pirit quenched in regard of the joy of the flame, but not quenched in regard of the fundamentall graces thereof, not in regard of the fire of it. The flame was downe, but the fire was alive. That the flame was quenched it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, becauÅ¿e he prayes, <hi>ReÅ¿tore to me the joy of thy Å¿alvation,</hi> as if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, Lord kindle this flame againe, therefore the flame was quencht: But yet the Å¿pirit was not taken away in the fundamentall graces thereof, for he Å¿aith, <hi>Take not away thy Å¿pirit from me.</hi> If that had beene taken away, he would have Å¿aid, ReÅ¿tore to me thy Å¿pirit againe, as he doth his joy which his Å¿in had quencht; but Å¿aying, Take not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that argues that hee Å¿till had the Å¿pirit, though the joy was gone. He was Å¿till as an <hi>Oake</hi> which had caÅ¿t her <hi>leafe,</hi> he had his Å¿ubÅ¿tance in him: he had loÅ¿t his <hi>leafe,</hi> his joy was gone, but hee had not loÅ¿t his <hi>life;</hi> Gods Spirit was Å¿till in him; untaken from him.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But this may be a Doctrine of Å¿ecurity; what care I for quenching the flame, Å¿o long as the fire goes not out? what care I for my <hi>joy,</hi> if I loÅ¿e not my <hi>faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The righteous muÅ¿t be a tree not only bringing forth fruit, but a <hi>Tree alÅ¿o whoÅ¿e leafe muÅ¿t not wither, PÅ¿al.</hi> 1.3. 2. There is little comfort in <hi>life</hi> when there wants a <hi>leafe;</hi> little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in <hi>faith,</hi> when by Å¿inne we quench our <hi>joy.</hi> A man when he is a colde takes no pleaÅ¿ure in a fire that burnes not, flames not, it does him no good to Å¿ee the coales lye Å¿mothering under green wood. Though a man have the radicall graces, yet little comfort in them during the want of the other: BecauÅ¿e whilÅ¿t theÅ¿e Å¿econdary grace are wanting, it brings the conÅ¿cience to queÅ¿tion the preÅ¿ence and truth of the primary ones. The want of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150587:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>leafe</hi> makes the conÅ¿cience queÅ¿tion the <hi>life</hi> of grace. If there were any comfort in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, what needed <hi>David,</hi> having the <hi>Å¿pirit,</hi> beg to have his <hi>Joy</hi> reÅ¿tored? And what makes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted conÅ¿ciences in time of tentation call into queÅ¿tion the truth of their fundamentall graces, but the want of their flame, of their leafe: So that this gives no way at all to carnall Å¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. According to the Å¿econd <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinction,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FirÅ¿t, there are the infuÅ¿ed habits of Faith, Hope, Love, theÅ¿e habits cannot be loÅ¿t, and Å¿o in regard of theÅ¿e habits the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> cannot be quencht.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is the act, uÅ¿e, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿e of them: In that regard the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> may be quenched: For though the habit of faith cannot be killed, yet the act, uÅ¿e, and exerciÅ¿e of it may bee deaded, Å¿o as it may not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent act and worke, and a man not uÅ¿e it. A man in his drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e loÅ¿eth the uÅ¿e, but not the faculty of ReaÅ¿on. A man in his Å¿leepe loÅ¿eth the uÅ¿e, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150587:17"/> not the faculty of his Å¿enÅ¿e. Sinne and temptation may as much diÅ¿temper the Å¿oule, as Wine and Å¿trong drinke may doe the braine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the meaÅ¿ure and degree, in that regard the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> may be quencht. A man may come to have a leÅ¿Å¿e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of faith, hope, love, a leÅ¿Å¿e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of joy and zeale. The degrees of theÅ¿e may be abated, and yet the things themÅ¿elves remaine, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.4. It is laid to the charge of the Angel of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿us, That he had loÅ¿t his firÅ¿t love;</hi> he Å¿ayes not, he had loÅ¿t his love, or all his love, but his firÅ¿t love, that degree of love he had at firÅ¿t; he had love Å¿till, but it was not Å¿o fervent as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was abated in the degree of it, and Å¿o the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> was quenched in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. So then, looke upon the habits of grace, and in regard of the habit, there is no <hi>amiÅ¿sion</hi> of grace: Looke upon the act, and in regard of the act, there may bee an <hi>intermiÅ¿sion</hi> of it: Looke upon the degree, and in regard of the degree, there may be a <hi>remiÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> A <hi>remiÅ¿sion</hi> of degrees, an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿sion</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:150587:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> of acts, but no utter <hi>amiÅ¿sion</hi> of habits, of fundamentall Å¿aving Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace.

                  <p>And here firÅ¿t begin with the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, <hi>Quench not the Å¿pirit.</hi> And out of it learne</p>
                  <p>The nature of the Spirit of God, and Å¿pirit of grace. That the Å¿pirit of God is of the nature of fire: Å¿o much the word <hi>quench</hi> implyes, for nothing is properly quenched but fire; <hi>Quench not the Å¿pirit,</hi> is as much as quench not the fire of the Å¿pirit. The Spirit of God then is of the nature of fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>He Å¿hall baptize you with the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and with fire,</hi> that is, with the Holy Spirit which is as fire, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.49. <hi>Every man Å¿hall be Å¿alted with fire:</hi> what fire? As the fire of afflictions, and the the fire of the word, Å¿o the fire of the Å¿pirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>There appeared to them cloven tongues with fire, and they were all filled with the Holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Spirit</hi> is compared to water, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 44.3. And Å¿ometimes againe to fire.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150587:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> As the Word of God is a fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>Is not my Word a fire?</hi> Å¿o is his Spirit a fire. Is not my Spirit a fire? And the Spirit is compared to fire in theÅ¿e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. FirÅ¿t, Fire, it gives <hi>light:</hi> And therefore in the want of the light of the Sunne, we make uÅ¿e of fire to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us light for doing our workes. The Sunne was not created till the fourth day, and yet there was light all the three firÅ¿t dayes, which Å¿ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to have beene from the element of fire under the Å¿phere of the Moone, which gave light unto the world. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21. <hi>They had a piller of fire by night to give them light:</hi> Fire and light goe together. So is it with the Spirit of God. It is a Spirit of light, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.17, 18. All Å¿pirituall illumination comes from this fire. Gods Spirit is an inlightning Å¿pirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man perceiveth not the things of God; neither can he, becauÅ¿e they be Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diÅ¿cerned,</hi> viz. by the light of the Spirit, which Spirit a naturall man wanting, hee is in the darke for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150587:19"/> want of light that Å¿hould Å¿hew unto him divine truths. The Spirit of God is fire that brings light with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever Gods Spirit comes there comes light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, fire as it gives light, Å¿o it alÅ¿o gives <hi>heate;</hi> fire and heate are inÅ¿eparable: when our bodies are pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with cold in the winter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the fire wee are warmed and heated; fire warmes and heates that which is cold, and by the heat of it thawes and melts that which is frozen. Thus is it with the Spirit of God, it is an heating warming Spirit, it warmes and heates the affections, our hearts that are frozen and cold in prayer, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it heates and warmes them, it melts and inlarges them. It kindles both affections of love, zeale, Joy. The Spirit of God will make a mans heart burne within, in the hearing of the Word, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us when he opened the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> It will make a mans heart glow and flame in prayer, it will melt a mans heart, and make it drop at a mans eyes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150587:19"/> as Ice thawes and drops againÅ¿t the fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Fire as it heates and warmes, Å¿o it alÅ¿o <hi>burnes and conÅ¿umes</hi> whatever combuÅ¿tible matter it lights and layes hold upon: It feedes upon combuÅ¿tible matter, and leaves not till it have brought it into aÅ¿hes. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.16. Fire is one of the <hi>foure things that never Å¿ayes it is enough.</hi> A little Å¿parke of fire burnes downe and conÅ¿umes whole houÅ¿es and Townes. It is ever in action, and eating up and conÅ¿uming what it lights upon. So is it with the Spirit of God and the graces of it: When the Spirit of God comes once into a mans heart, looke what combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tible matter it findes there, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umes and eates it up: it will conÅ¿ume and burne up our luÅ¿ts and corruptions.

Now then, when we have Å¿uch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Å¿uch breathings, Å¿tirrings, flutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, then Å¿hould our care be not to quench theÅ¿e, but to cheriÅ¿h, kindle, and uphold theÅ¿e motions. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150587:26"/> of God is fire, the motions of the Å¿pirit, are the Å¿parkes of this fire; now our care Å¿hould be not to <hi>quench</hi> theÅ¿e Å¿parkes, not to let them goe out, but to kindle and cheriÅ¿h them unto a great fire, unto flame. It is Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>That he will not quench the Å¿moaking flaxe.</hi> That if there be in a mans heart but a Å¿mall Å¿parke of grace, Å¿o Å¿mall that it burnes not, but onely makes a little Å¿moake, and a poore Å¿mother, yet he will not quench it, but he will make much of it, cheriÅ¿h and foÅ¿ter it till it kindle and grow to a great fire: So Å¿hould it be with us, when the Spirit of God injects and caÅ¿ts into our hearts but the Å¿parkes of fire in the gracious motions thereof, quench not thoÅ¿e Å¿parkes, cheriÅ¿h and kindle thoÅ¿e Å¿parkes, keepe them from <hi>quenching</hi> and dying, and going out.</p>
                  <p>Now for the doing of theÅ¿e two things are required: FirÅ¿t, have a care to take notice of the motions of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> watch where hee moves and Å¿tirres, that a good motion may no Å¿ooner Å¿tirre in thine heart, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150587:27"/> thou maiÅ¿t preÅ¿ently be able to Å¿ay, This is Gods Spirit, theÅ¿e be the flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings of the Eagles wings, this good motion is from Gods Spirit. Thus doth the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. whilÅ¿t Å¿he is in that holy diÅ¿courÅ¿e, Å¿he findes a good motion Å¿tirring, and abruptly Å¿he breakes off, and Å¿ayes, <hi>The voyce of my welbeloved.</hi> Now ChriÅ¿t Å¿peakes by the good motions of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is that, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I heard a voyce behind me,</hi> and verÅ¿. 12. <hi>And I turned to Å¿ee the voyce that Å¿pake with me.</hi> The <hi>voyce</hi> was behinde him at his backe; now when he heares the <hi>voyce</hi> behinde him, he does not goe on, and never minde, and not vouchÅ¿afe once to looke backe and to heed it, but hee turnes him about to Å¿ee the <hi>voyce</hi> that Å¿pake with him, to take more Å¿peciall notice of what was Å¿aid: So when we heare that voyce of the Spirit in the motions of it, and heare it behinde us, we Å¿hould not goe on negligently and careleÅ¿ly, and leave and caÅ¿t it behinde our backes, but turne about to Å¿ee the <hi>voyce,</hi> take Å¿peciall and Å¿erious notice
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150587:27"/> of it. Doe as the people did at the poole of <hi>BetheÅ¿da,</hi> they Å¿ate watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the mooving of the waters by the Angel, that the waters could no Å¿ooner move, but preÅ¿ently they Å¿aw it, obÅ¿erved it, tooke notice of it, and all cryed out the Angel moves in the waters. So Å¿hould we watch when at any time the Å¿pirit of God moves in our hearts, and take Å¿peciall notice of it; and Å¿ay, now Gods Å¿pirit Å¿peakes to mee, this is the <hi>voyce</hi> of the Å¿pirit. That when a good motion Å¿tirres in our hearts, we might be able to Å¿ay as <hi>Jacob</hi> upon his dreame, Å¿urely God is here, Å¿urely Gods Å¿pirit is here.

The way to keepe faith in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, in life, to keepe it from quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the deÅ¿ire, to make it grow and increaÅ¿e, is to put faith to it, to keepe it in action, to keepe it in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e, and to make it put forth it Å¿elfe in frequent acts. So long as faith is on the increaÅ¿ing hand, Å¿o long no feare of its quenching or decaying; Å¿o long as faith is acted and in exerciÅ¿e, Å¿o long it is on the increaÅ¿ing hand; every new and freÅ¿h act of faith adds growth and increaÅ¿e to it: the uÅ¿e of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿es faith; and the more freÅ¿h acts of beleeving, the more the habit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving is increaÅ¿ed: Many acts Å¿trengthen and increaÅ¿e habits. Marke how that man Å¿peakes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. ChriÅ¿t tells him, if hee can beleeve, hee can heale his childe: Lord Å¿ayes he, <hi>helpe my unbeliefe;</hi> as if hee Å¿hould Å¿ay, Lord I would faine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,

I but firÅ¿t, Å¿ayes he, <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe my unbeliefe.</hi> That act of his in putting forth his faith to beleeve as he could, was the way to overcome his unbeliefe, and to come to beleeve as he would. The way to have the faith we would have, is to uÅ¿e and Å¿et on worke the faith we already have. See <hi>John</hi> 1.48, 49, 50, 51. as if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, Since thou art Å¿o ready to beleeve upon Å¿o Å¿mall a ground, therefore thou Å¿halt Å¿ee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then theÅ¿e. Great matters Å¿hall be revealed unto thee, that Å¿hall Å¿et thy faith on worke in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure. The way then to keepe faith in vigour and in life, is to Å¿et faith fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on worke, and to have it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and forward to beleeve. Take the promiÅ¿es, and Å¿et them before thee, and put thy faith on worke upon them, and Å¿tirre up thine heart to beleeve them Å¿trive to act thy faith in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, and this will keepe thy faith <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>vigorous.</hi> When faith is not exerciÅ¿ed, and Å¿et, and kept to

Now when there is fire, and fuell, and bellowes blowing, there is no danger of the fyre going out, there is no queÅ¿tion but that the fire will burne and be kept alive.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150587:43"/> from quenching, to kindle and keepe it alive in us. And therefore Å¿uch as would take heede of quenching, as would kindle and preÅ¿erve this fire burning, they muÅ¿t come to this fire, and catch fire at it, muÅ¿t lay on this wood, muÅ¿t come under the blaÅ¿t of theÅ¿e bellowes: that is, they muÅ¿t come to, and attend upon the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿try of the word. And what is it that more and Å¿ooner quenches the Spirit then the want, and neglect of the miniÅ¿try of the word. Many that have had faire lamps blazing, faire fires bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e that it may be Å¿aid of them, as <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 43.17. <hi>They are extinct, they are quenched as towe.</hi> When wood burnes, &amp; after quenches yet for Å¿ome good time after there remaine Å¿ome coales, and Å¿ome fire Å¿till, but when burning towe quenches it leaves no fire or heate at all, it goes Å¿uddenly quite out.

In blowing of the fire, the Å¿maller wood takes fire firÅ¿t, and that being fired, it fires the greater wood. Many times men that have greater meaÅ¿ures of gifts and knowledge, may want heat and be Å¿hort in their fervour and zeale, and they by their communion with ChriÅ¿tians of meaner ranke, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gifts than themÅ¿elves, may bee warmed, and heated, and have the fire of love and zeale kindled in them. We Å¿ee that greene wood will hardly burn alone; lay that on the fire alone, and what a deale of blowing and Å¿tirring muÅ¿t there be ere it will take fire; and if it doe take fire, it will hardly burne any longer than it is blowne, and but poorly then neither: But now lay green wood on the fire with dry wood, and the dry wood not onely burnes it Å¿elfe, but Å¿ets the greene wood on fire alÅ¿o, and makes it burne to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e.

All riÅ¿es to this, that the more wee have our hearts enlarged in prayer, the more will the Lord enlarge his hands in the graces of the <hi>Spirit.

So his thoughts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, deÅ¿ires, they reeke and riÅ¿e upwards, they Å¿moake heaven-wards.

Now when he moves thee to doe theÅ¿e things, at the Å¿ame time he offers his <hi>helpe</hi> for the doing of them, he offers his <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>asÅ¿iÅ¿tance</hi> to <hi>beleeve,</hi> to <hi>repent,</hi> to <hi>pray.</hi> And a man that takes the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath alÅ¿o his <hi>helpe,</hi> and is <hi>enabled</hi> by him to <hi>doe</hi> theÅ¿e things.</p>
                  <p>As in that caÅ¿e <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.17. <hi>As he was teaching, the power of God was preÅ¿ent to heale them:</hi> So it is in the motions of the Spirit, as he is <hi>teaching, urging, preÅ¿sing</hi> us to any duty, <hi>the power of the Lord is juÅ¿t then preÅ¿ent</hi> to <hi>helpe</hi> a man,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150587:69"/> and the man that hearkens to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Å¿hall be Å¿ure to have that <hi>helpe</hi> of the <hi>power of God</hi> that is then <hi>preÅ¿ent.</hi> As there in that caÅ¿e, <hi>The power of the Lord was preÅ¿ent then to heale them, as he was teaching:</hi> And Å¿ee what followed upon it, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 18. <hi>And behold men brought in a bed a man taken with the palÅ¿ey:</hi> When did they bring him? JuÅ¿t then <hi>when the power of God was preÅ¿ent to heale.</hi> They tooke the very inch of time: And how Å¿ped they? He that was brought in his bed, walkes away with his bed, and goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whole. So happy a thing it is to take the advantage of Gods helpe when <hi>his power is preÅ¿ent to helpe.</hi> JuÅ¿t Å¿o it is in the <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> when he <hi>moves</hi> to <hi>repentance, his power is preÅ¿ent to help</hi> a man to <hi>repent.</hi> And let a man then beÅ¿tirre himÅ¿elfe, and though he have as little power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent as the palÅ¿ey man had to walke, yet the power of God, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent at the motion made, will doe as much for his Å¿oule, as it did for that mans body.</p>

                  <p>See 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 14.15.16. <hi>When David Å¿hould heare a Å¿ound of going in the tops of the Mulberry Trees, then he muÅ¿t goe out to battell, for then God was preÅ¿ent with his power to Å¿mite the PhiliÅ¿tines.</hi> Well, <hi>David</hi> did Å¿o as God commanded him, juÅ¿t when he heares the Å¿ound of goings hee goes out, juÅ¿t then; and what was the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e? <hi>And they Å¿mote the HoÅ¿t of the PhiliÅ¿tines.</hi> Hee tooke the advantage of Gods preÅ¿ence and power that was then preÅ¿ent to helpe him, and Å¿o hee did the deede, went thorow happily with the worke.

But alas! they be hard things; alas!

AriÅ¿e Salomon,</hi> and <hi>be</hi> building and doing, and the Lord helpe thee.

                  <p>But now when men <hi>quench the Å¿pirit of God</hi> in theÅ¿e <hi>motions,</hi> and doe not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> them, nor <hi>hearken</hi> to them, and <hi>yeeld</hi> a preÅ¿ent <hi>obedience</hi> to them, here is the danger of it, that they <hi>loÅ¿e</hi> this <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>asÅ¿iÅ¿tance</hi> of the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> which then was to be had, and Å¿o when after
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150587:71"/> they would doe theÅ¿e things they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe them, becauÅ¿e now they muÅ¿t doe them alone, and by their owne Å¿trength; and their own Å¿trength is too weake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> went out againÅ¿t the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿tines juÅ¿t when he heard the Å¿ound of <hi>goings in the top of the Mulberry trees, and Å¿o he Å¿mites the PhiliÅ¿tines;</hi> and why Å¿o? BecauÅ¿e when the Å¿ound of the goings was, then <hi>God was preÅ¿ent to help him:</hi> But now Å¿uppoÅ¿e <hi>David</hi> when he had heard that <hi>Å¿ound of the goings</hi> had Å¿at Å¿till, and had Å¿aid with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, There is no Å¿uch haÅ¿te of going out againÅ¿t the PhiliÅ¿tines, Å¿uppoÅ¿e he had put it off till next day, or for a matter of 3. or 4. houres; what would have beene the iÅ¿Å¿ue?

                  <p>And this very thing is that which <hi>undoes</hi> men, and a maine reaÅ¿on that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150587:71"/> they never come to <hi>beleeve, repent,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>Behold I Å¿tand at the doore and knocke, Apoc.</hi> 3. <hi>If any man will open.</hi> Alas! we cannot open the doore, it is Å¿o locked, and barred, and bolted, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿Å¿ible for us to open it. True, it is Å¿o, but yet there is a way to <hi>open,</hi> and that is to be opening when God would helpe us to open. When God offers to helpe thee to <hi>open the doore,</hi> then Å¿et

                  <p>I but when doth God offer to help us to open it? Then when his Spirit <hi>knocks,</hi> when in the motions thereof he Å¿ollicites us to <hi>open,</hi> then God offers his help to help us to <hi>open.</hi> Take that time, and then Å¿et on the work, and the <hi>doore</hi> Å¿hall be <hi>opened.</hi> But if that time be neglected, we may Å¿trive to <hi>open</hi> but cannot <hi>open,</hi> becauÅ¿e then that power is gone that would have helpt us to <hi>open.</hi> See <hi>EccleÅ¿.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Man alÅ¿o knowes not his time.</hi> This is one cauÅ¿e of mans miÅ¿ery, that hee <hi>knowes not his time,</hi> that he miÅ¿Å¿es the time of doing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe moÅ¿t good. Not to Å¿trike in and cloÅ¿e with God when hee offers his helpe, is to miÅ¿Å¿e our time, and this makes us miÅ¿erable. And this miÅ¿ery of miÅ¿Å¿ing our time is the fruit of <hi>quenehing the Å¿pirit.</hi> The time of Gods helpe is the time of his Spirits Å¿ollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

Now, how could Å¿uch a man tell whether ever the Angel would move againe or no? There was a time when that miracle ceaÅ¿ed, there was a motion of the Angel which was his laÅ¿t motion; There was a motion after which there was never any motion more. Now then, how could Å¿uch a man tell, but that motion which hee neglected might be the laÅ¿t?

See <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 45. where obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. FirÅ¿t, that in a caÅ¿e of ApoÅ¿tacy the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> being <hi>quencht,</hi> the Divell doth not enter Å¿ingle, <hi>but he takes Å¿even other Å¿pirits more wicked than himÅ¿elfe.</hi> ChriÅ¿t caÅ¿t Å¿even Divels out of <hi>Mary Magdalen, Mar,</hi> 16.9. theÅ¿e have Å¿even Divels enter with the former old Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and they be worÅ¿e Divels than himÅ¿elfe. To teach, that when men <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> by falling away, the Divell not onely comes againe, but he comes Å¿o, that hee makes them Å¿even times worÅ¿e than ever they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, thoÅ¿e 7. <hi>Divels</hi> not only <hi>enter,</hi> but <hi>dwell</hi> there, not onely <hi>lodge</hi> there for a night and away, but they <hi>dwell</hi> there. It notes, that upon the <hi>departure</hi> and <hi>quenching</hi> of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Divell is not onely preÅ¿ent in their hearts, but hath his abode and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:150587:85"/> reÅ¿idence there, as in that caÅ¿e, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.11. Where a man dwels, there is his Å¿etled abode and reÅ¿idence. And that's not all, but that hee alÅ¿o was there as a Lord and MaÅ¿ter, as <hi>EÅ¿th.</hi> 1.22. So that it teaches, that when the Spirit is quenched, not onely the Å¿pirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan comes in his roome, but he comes powerfully and efficaciouÅ¿ly to reigne in their hearts, and Å¿o to make them baÅ¿er vaÅ¿Å¿als to himÅ¿elfe than ever they were before; Å¿o that their latter end Å¿hall be worÅ¿e than their beginning, not onely in regard of their miÅ¿ery, but of their guilt and pollution. This is the dreadfull danger of <hi>quenching</hi> Gods <hi>Å¿pirit:</hi> It makes way for the re-entry of Satans Å¿pirit, yea for Å¿even Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits worÅ¿e than himÅ¿elfe. As therefore wee dread Å¿uch a condition, and Å¿uch a danger, Å¿o let us beware of Å¿uch a Å¿inne as <hi>quenching the Å¿pirit.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">A third danger of quenching the Spirit, wee may doe it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and totally.</note>3. Thirdly, a third danger is, that a man <hi>quenching the Å¿pirit</hi> in the graces of it, may quench it finally and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the <hi>quenching</hi> of the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> may prove totall and finall. Indeed the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:150587:85"/> Å¿anctifying <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God wee Å¿aw before, cannot be Å¿o <hi>quenched;</hi> but yet the <hi>flame</hi> of that <hi>fire</hi> may bee Å¿o <hi>quenched,</hi> that a man may Å¿it a <hi>cold</hi> a long while after, and Å¿uch a <hi>fire kindled</hi> in his conÅ¿cience withall, as may make him rue his folly that doth it: Yea, the <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>opperations</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> Å¿o <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> as not eaÅ¿ily brought to <hi>life</hi> againe, and the <hi>degrees</hi> and <hi>meaÅ¿ures</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> Å¿o <hi>quenched,</hi> as poÅ¿Å¿ibly never recovered againe, though the <hi>habits</hi> remaine. And that's Å¿uch a danger as may make any wiÅ¿e man take heed of <hi>quenching the Å¿pirit</hi> Å¿o.</p>
                  <p>But now for common <hi>graces,</hi> they may be Å¿o <hi>quenched,</hi> as <hi>quenched</hi> total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and finally. Totally, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 53.3. <hi>They are gone backward, they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther become filthy.</hi> Altogether, they are altogether <hi>quencht,</hi> not a <hi>Å¿park</hi> of good or grace left in them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Take from him his pound,</hi> not part of his pound, not halfe of his pound, but <hi>take the</hi> whole <hi>pound from him, Luk.</hi> 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Finally, like the fire that came from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150587:86"/> Heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. after it was <hi>quencht</hi> at the deÅ¿truction of the Temple, it was finally <hi>quencht,</hi> it was never <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled</hi> more. For as for that Å¿tory about that fire, 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. it is but an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall fable. They have made Å¿hip-wrack of faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. When a Shippe wrackes at Sea, the goods are utterly loÅ¿t, without all recovery. Goods caÅ¿t away at Sea, are loÅ¿t for ever. As he of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. Å¿o here it is a queÅ¿tion, and it proves too Å¿ure that Å¿uch live not after they are fallen: BecauÅ¿e they fall as <hi>Eli</hi> fell, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. hee fell backward, and his necke brake, and hee dyed. When men fall backward, they breake their neckes and dye, they fall fatally and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the <hi>quenching of the Spirit</hi> makes dangerous way to the dreadfull and unpardonable Å¿inne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Holy GhoÅ¿t. Woe to that Å¿oule that commits that Å¿inne, that man is paÅ¿t the helpe of prayer. His damnation is irreverÅ¿ibly Å¿ealed up. There bee diverÅ¿e Å¿innes againÅ¿t the

And this laÅ¿t is that which wee call the Å¿inne againÅ¿t the Holy GhoÅ¿t. And marke that the firÅ¿t Å¿tep to this Å¿inne, is the <hi>quenching of the Å¿pirit.</hi> Here that Å¿inne begins.

And this Å¿inne of the <hi>quenching the Å¿pirit,</hi> is the firÅ¿t Å¿tayre of the fire. A danger able to make our hearts tremble. Is it not dangerous to Å¿tep one Å¿tayre downe towards Hell? If thou wilt adventure to goe downe one Å¿tep, what canÅ¿t thou tell but thou mayÅ¿t goe downe the Å¿econd, the third, &amp;c. If thou wilt adventure to <hi>quench the Å¿pirit,</hi> thou

As Å¿urely <hi>damn'd,</hi> as irrecoverably gone, as if thou wert in <hi>Hell</hi> already. Would we then avoid the danger of that Å¿inne of <hi>deÅ¿pighting?</hi> why then, take heede of vexing; if not <hi>vex,</hi> take heed of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ting;</hi> if not <hi>reÅ¿iÅ¿t,</hi> take heede of <hi>grieving;</hi> if of <hi>grieving,</hi> take heede of <hi>quenching:</hi> Hee that keepes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe from <hi>quenching,</hi> Å¿hall never come to a <hi>deÅ¿pighting</hi> of the <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> But if thou wilt be too bold to <hi>meddle</hi> with the <hi>firÅ¿t,</hi> take heed that thou <hi>come</hi> not to the <hi>laÅ¿t.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly, the <hi>quenching</hi> of Gods <hi>Å¿pirit</hi> and the <hi>fire</hi> of it, will prove the <hi>kindling</hi> of the <hi>fire</hi> of GODS <hi>wrath.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it may and will <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> in <hi>eternall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Did yee never reade of a <hi>fire

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150587:94"/> pardon taking away iniquity, that is the onely thing, that can give a Å¿mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting conÅ¿cience eaÅ¿e: Then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience is at eaÅ¿e when the weapon is taken away with which conÅ¿cience Å¿mites.

                     <hi>PÅ¿alme</hi> 38.3. <hi>There is not any reÅ¿t in my bones becauÅ¿e of my Å¿in;</hi> when a man hath a grivous ach and paine in his bones, it Å¿o afflicts and tortures him that he can take no reÅ¿t, lay him upon never Å¿o Å¿oft a bed, yet his aking bones will not let him take any reÅ¿t. But the way to bring a man to reÅ¿t, were to take a courÅ¿e to take away that paine out of his bones: If that ach and paine were out of his bones, hee might reÅ¿t. So here, Å¿inne in the conÅ¿cience makes the bones full of reÅ¿tleÅ¿Å¿e paines, <hi>There is no reÅ¿t in my bones becauÅ¿e of my Å¿inne.</hi> It breakes the bones, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 51.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150587:95"/> dryes the bones, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 38. and puts bones out of joynt, but it breakes the bones, and Å¿o no wonder that upon Å¿inne there is no reÅ¿t in the bones: But now if Å¿in were taken away, the bones would Å¿oone be at reÅ¿t. And therefore pardon of Å¿in taking away Å¿in, which cauÅ¿es the reÅ¿tleÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of the bones, is the onely thing to procure reÅ¿t in the bones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PÅ¿alme</hi> 38.4. <hi>My Å¿innes are as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie burthen, they are too heavie for mee.</hi> A man that hath an heavie &amp; weighty burthen upon his backe, can have no reÅ¿t till the burden be taken off his back, though hee may Å¿eeke to eaÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe by Å¿itting down, by leaning, yet Å¿o long as the weighty burden is upon his back, he can have no eaÅ¿e, Å¿till hee is under the pinch, and preÅ¿Å¿ure of it. But the onely way to give his backe eaÅ¿e, is to remove the burden, and to take it off. Sinne is a heavie and a preÅ¿Å¿ing burden, that is ready to breake a mans backe. Now the only way to give a mans back eaÅ¿e, is to remove this burden, and to take it off. Now pardon of Å¿inne is the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150587:95"/> removing of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Remove farre from me vanitie and lies.</hi> and <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 103.12. <hi>So far hath he removed our tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿sions from us.</hi> And therefore pardon being the removing of the burden, and the removing of the cauÅ¿e of the paine, it is the onely thing that gives the back eaÅ¿e. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Come unto mee all yee that are heavie loaden, and I will eaÅ¿e you.</hi> How?

                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ReaÅ¿. </seg>2</label> all trouble and diÅ¿quiet of conÅ¿cience is from the feare and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿ion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:150587:96"/> of wrath. The clouds that are in Gods face cauÅ¿e the Å¿tormes that are in the conÅ¿cience. That as in that caÅ¿e hee Å¿peakes, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 104.19. <hi>Thou hideÅ¿t thy face, they are troubled:</hi> So in this caÅ¿e, when God hides his face and his favour, and men Å¿ee nothing but anger and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, yea it may bee Å¿ee hell and damnation, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience is troubled and diÅ¿quieted. Then a man <hi>Å¿uckes the gall of AÅ¿pes, and then the Vipers tongue Å¿layes him, Job</hi> 20.16. The trouble of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ariÅ¿ing therefore from the dread and apprehenÅ¿ion of Gods anger and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, the onely thing that can eaÅ¿e the conÅ¿cience, is the hope and Å¿enÅ¿e of Gods favour; let but God give a man a good looke, but Å¿mile lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly upon him, and that favor of God eaÅ¿es the conÅ¿cience of all trouble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>The wrath of a King is as the meÅ¿Å¿engers of death;</hi> Å¿o Gods wrath much more, and when meÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of death come, how is a mans heart troubled and diÅ¿quieted: <hi>But a wiÅ¿e man will pacifie it.</hi> And what if it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:150587:96"/> be pacified: Then, <hi>in the light of the Kings countenance is life:</hi> So when God lifts up the light of his countenance, then there is life, and then the conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is full of peace and eaÅ¿e. I but when is it that the light and Sun-Å¿hine of Gods face breakes out thus? That is done in the pardon of Å¿inne: When Å¿inne is pardoned then comes peace and comfort, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thy Å¿innes are forgiven thee.</hi> That is the onely thing that can comfort the conÅ¿cience, and eaÅ¿e it, becauÅ¿e that is an infallible evidence of Gods favour. Pardon of Å¿inne never comes but out of love and favour. Outward mercies a man may receive from an <hi>angry God,</hi> but pardon of Å¿inne never comes but from <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> And therefore pardon of Å¿inne being the evidence of a God reconciled, Å¿hewing a man the light of Gods countenance, is the onely thing that can eaÅ¿e the trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Å¿innes are debts. And a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> man that is in his guilt, is in his debt, and Å¿o in danger before God. Now a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:150587:97"/> man that is deepely in debt, cannot be without much trouble of heart. It may be he may make a Å¿hift, and Å¿et a face upon it before men: I but yet the thoughts of his debts give him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Å¿ecret nip, many a cloÅ¿e pinch. He may Å¿et up an high Å¿ayle, and brave it out in apparell, but yet for all this his debts vex him, and many a night hee takes but little reÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e Å¿till the thoughts of his debts trouble him. Now when a man is in this trouble of heart, and diÅ¿quiet of Å¿pirit with his debts, there is no way for a man to have his heart eaÅ¿ed, but either to get his debts <hi>paid,</hi> or to get his debts <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</hi> And if they be Å¿uch, as hee is never able to pay, then no way to eaÅ¿e him of his cares and feares, but to have his debts <hi>pardoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a Å¿inner is in debt to God, and when conÅ¿cience is troubled about theÅ¿e debts, what ever face a man may Å¿et upon it, yet his heart will be miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably troubled about his debts; hee will live in a continuall feare of being arreÅ¿ted by Gods anger, of being
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:150587:97"/> drag'd by the throat to hell: For Å¿uch debts they are, as a man can never pay, <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. <hi>Two debtors that had nothing to pay:</hi> So therefore there is no other way to give a mans conÅ¿cience eaÅ¿e, but by the pardon of his Å¿innes, becauÅ¿e that is the pardoning of his debts: Therefore pardon of Å¿inne is called <hi>blotting out iniquity, PÅ¿al.</hi> 51. It is the drawing croÅ¿Å¿e lines over all our debts, it is the blurring out all our Å¿innes in Gods debt-booke. Pardon of <hi>debts</hi> is the onely way to eaÅ¿e a diÅ¿quieted <hi>debtor,</hi> pardon of <hi>Å¿inne</hi> is the pardon of <hi>debts,</hi> and therefore the onely way to eaÅ¿e our conÅ¿ciences.</p>
                  <p>To teach us in trouble of ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and under the Å¿mitings of heart, what courÅ¿e to take for eaÅ¿e and peace, viz. to make out preÅ¿ently as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> does for pardon of Å¿in, make haÅ¿t to God, and Å¿ue for pardon, and give God and thy Å¿elfe no reÅ¿t, till thou haÅ¿t got thy pardon. If thine heart Å¿mite thee, and thy conÅ¿cience pinch thee, fall preÅ¿ently to this courÅ¿e, <hi>I beÅ¿eech thee O Lord take away the iniquitie of thy
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:150587:98"/> Å¿ervant.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> Å¿peakes in the caÅ¿e of Å¿uretieÅ¿hip, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.1, 5. So doe thou, If thou haÅ¿t Å¿inned, and thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience have Å¿tricken thee with the hand, doe this now my Å¿on, and deliver thy Å¿elfe from the painful and Å¿marting buffetings of thy conÅ¿cience. So hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy Å¿elfe, and make Å¿ure thy friend, Å¿ee and humble thy Å¿elfe by confeÅ¿Å¿ion, and by begging, and getting thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, make God thy friend, and make him thy Å¿ure friend, and do this quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 4, 5. This is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to get eaÅ¿e, this is the only way to get reÅ¿t in thy bones. It is Å¿trange how men in paine of ConÅ¿cience will Å¿harke for eaÅ¿e, and try all concluÅ¿ions, before they will take the right courÅ¿e to come, and Å¿ue to God for eaÅ¿e by pardon. The Prodigall was in want, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. why doth hee not Å¿o Å¿oone as he is pincht goe to his Father? no, hee will try other concluÅ¿ions firÅ¿t. Hee joynes to a citizen, it may bee he may finde helpe that way: Hee will keepe Å¿wine, it may be he <hi>may fil his belly with the huskes:</hi> But when he hath done all,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150587:98"/> that will give him no eaÅ¿e, hee muÅ¿t come to this at laÅ¿t, I will goe to my Father, I will goe beg mercy; And he never finds eaÅ¿e, till he be in his fathers Armes, in his Fathers houÅ¿e, till his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kiÅ¿Å¿es him and cloathes him. So men in trouble of conÅ¿cience are loth to make out to Gods pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Some will try what company will doe, Å¿ome will try what pleaÅ¿ures will doe, it may bee they may drinke away their trouble, and drowne it that way; it may bee they card and dice it away; it may be they may; it may bee they may hauke and hunt it away; it may be Å¿uperÅ¿titious penance, a pilgrimage, a Popes pardon will doe the deede, it may be, multitude and variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t may take off the heart Å¿o, that it Å¿hal not beat leaÅ¿ure to trouble them with accuÅ¿ations and torments. How vaine are all theÅ¿e: This is nothing but arrand Å¿harking: All Å¿uch courÅ¿es will not doe. It is in that caÅ¿e as in that, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 5.13. <hi>When Ephraim Å¿aw his Å¿ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and Juda Å¿aw his wound: then went Ephraim to the AÅ¿Å¿yrian, and Å¿ent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150587:99"/> to King Jareb; yet could hee not heale you, not cure you of your wound.</hi> So when men Å¿ee their Å¿pirituall Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, and feele the wounds of conÅ¿cience, the Å¿mart and the anguiÅ¿h of them, then go they to this Å¿hift, and that, to this Å¿har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king courÅ¿e, and that; they go to their merriments, companions, Å¿ports, plaies, imployments, Å¿uperÅ¿titions, and yet can they not heale them, nor cure them of their wounds; their wounds bleed Å¿till, Å¿mart Å¿till, their conÅ¿ciences throb with anguiÅ¿h Å¿till, and for all this, as with them there, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 14. ConÅ¿cience is <hi>as a Lion</hi> unto them, and <hi>roares and teares</hi> Å¿till. Men muÅ¿t come to God for pardon at laÅ¿t if they wil have eaÅ¿e. And were not a man as good come at firÅ¿t, and Å¿ave Å¿o much loÅ¿t labour? Had not the Prodigall as good have come to his father at firÅ¿t, as to goe the furtheÅ¿t away about?</p>
                  <p>Sin leaves a Å¿ting in the conÅ¿cience. When a man is Å¿tung with an Hornet, it afflicts the place with a great deale of anguiÅ¿h. And what will a man doe in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e? The firÅ¿t thing hee will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150587:99"/> doe for his eaÅ¿e, is to plucke out the Å¿ting, the Hornet hath left behinde: For if a man apply medicines for eaÅ¿e, yet if the Å¿ting be Å¿till Å¿ticking in his fleÅ¿h, medicines are in vaine. So when the conÅ¿cience is Å¿tung, and throbs, and rages, the way is firÅ¿t to plucke out the Å¿ting out of the conÅ¿cience. Nothing can take away the Å¿ting out of the conÅ¿cience, but pardon: <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning grace</hi> onely can fetch that out; therefore when thy conÅ¿cience is Å¿tung, and doth paine and vex thee, let that be the firÅ¿t thing, and let is bee done Å¿peedily too, to Å¿eeke to God for the <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>remiÅ¿sion</hi> of thy Å¿inne. That will take out the Å¿ting, and when the Å¿ting is out, there will follow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent eaÅ¿e.</p>

                  <p>The Lord, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 24.2. preÅ¿cribes his people a prayer, and that hath but two petitions, and this is not onely one of them, but the firÅ¿t of them, <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give us good. Agur</hi> put up but two petitions to God, and theÅ¿e were the petitions that he meant to put up to his dying day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny them mee not before I dye,</hi> that is, two things I have beg'd, and will not leave begging to my dying day; and one of theÅ¿e two, and the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e two things that he would beg to his dying day, was the <hi>pardon</hi> of his Å¿innes, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Remove farre from me vanity and lyes:</hi> As if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, Lord be mercifull unto mee in the pardon of my Å¿innes. So that there is no thought nor care that Å¿hould take up a mans time and paines all his life long, as this, how to get the pardon of our Å¿innes. It is the greateÅ¿t mercy that can be Å¿howne us. It is true that wee live wholly upon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150587:101"/> mercy; that we have a being it is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that wee have any comfortable being it is mercy; mercy that we have food to put into our bellies; mercy that wee have clothes to put upon our backs, mercy that we are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿orrowes, Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e, and heavy croÅ¿Å¿es that others lye under; <hi>all is mercy:</hi> but yet lay all together, and they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the mercy that is in <hi>pardon</hi> of Å¿inne; that is the greateÅ¿t mercy that can be Å¿hewed: <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 51.1. <hi>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tranÅ¿greÅ¿sions.</hi> See then, that it is mercy that muÅ¿t blot out tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nay it is tender mercy; nay it is a multitude of tender mercies that blots out and forgives Å¿inne. And therefore it being Å¿o great a mercy, our cares Å¿hould be Å¿uitable and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to it. The greater the mercy is, the greater Å¿hould a mans care be to get a Å¿hare in that mercy.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150587:101"/> great endeavour of our lives to get the pardon of our Å¿innes. It is wofull to Å¿ee our negligence and Å¿ecurity in this point. What is there in all the world that concernes men to looke after more, and yet what is there, that men looke after leÅ¿Å¿e than the pardon of their Å¿innes? No care, no thought, no time, no paines too much, or enough for getting goods, riches, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿aries of this life, but how rare and infrequent are mens cares &amp; thoughst for the pardon of Å¿in. All our cares are waÅ¿ted, and expended upon theÅ¿e tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, but for this one thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary, Å¿carce one Å¿erious thought in the whole yeere. <hi>Who will Å¿hew us any good?</hi> that Å¿tring men harpe upon. But who will Å¿hew us the way to get the <hi>pardon</hi> of our Å¿innes? that's a queÅ¿tion rarely asked.</p>
                  <p>It is too true, that men have not that care for their Å¿oules they have for their bruit beaÅ¿ts, for their very Hogs and Dogges, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Which of you Å¿hall have an AÅ¿Å¿e or an Oxe fallen into a pit, and will not Å¿traight way pull him
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150587:102"/> out:</hi> Nay, if it were a Swine, nay if a Dogge, hee Å¿hould be pul'd out, and pull'd out Å¿traight way. Such care and Å¿uch compaÅ¿Å¿ions would wee with haÅ¿te Å¿hew unto theÅ¿e vile and baÅ¿e creatures. But how often doe mens Å¿oules fall into the pit, even into the pit of Hell and Death by their Å¿innes? and yet no care nor compaÅ¿Å¿ion to pull them out, much leÅ¿Å¿e to pull them out Å¿traightway: But for any care or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience is taken there, their poore Å¿oules may lye and rot in the pit. A miÅ¿erable thing, that a man Å¿hould Å¿hew more care and pitie to his Swine, than to his Å¿oule. It being therefore the maine thing a Å¿inner Å¿hould labour for, to get his Å¿inne <hi>taken away,</hi> be we exhorted in Gods fear to make this our maine care: Spend leÅ¿Å¿e time and care upon the world, upon your profits and your pleaÅ¿ures, Å¿quander not out your cares, time and paines upon theÅ¿e vanities, theÅ¿e nothings. Spend Å¿ome time, Å¿pend Å¿ome care, Å¿ome paines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your poore Å¿oules, in getting their Å¿innes pardoned.</p>

Oh Lord that I had an heart to Å¿eeke out for my pardon!

Now, if many of us Å¿hould put <hi>Jobs queÅ¿tion</hi> to God, and Å¿ay, And why doeÅ¿t thou not pardon my tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ion, and take away mine iniquity; might not God <hi>anÅ¿wer</hi> us, And why doeÅ¿t thou not Å¿eeke for thy pardon, and why doeÅ¿t thou not labour for the taking away of thine iniquity. Why Å¿hould I pardon your iniquity, that take no care for your pardon? Why Å¿hould I forgive your iniquitie, that Å¿eeke not for the forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of it: Let

                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> our very life lyes upon it. Every Å¿inner in his guilt, having his Å¿inne unpardoned, let him be what he will, hee is no better than a dead man. That as God Å¿pake to <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou haÅ¿t taken.</hi> So, behold thou art but a dead man, and a dead woman for the Å¿inne which thou haÅ¿t committed, if thy Å¿inne be not pardoned. An unpardoned Å¿inner is but a <hi>dead man, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2.1.5. Wee uÅ¿e to Å¿ay of a condemned perÅ¿on, that hee is a dead man: But now when a mans Å¿inne is pardoned, then hee hath his life; as when the King gives a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man his pardon, wee Å¿ay hee gives him life. Our JuÅ¿tification is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>JuÅ¿tification of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. A maine part of our JuÅ¿tification is the pardon of Å¿inne: So that pardon of Å¿inne it is our life. <hi>I Å¿aid unto thee in thy blood, live, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 16.6. and <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Wee which were dead in Å¿innes hath hee quickned,</hi> made alive. How come wee to be made alive? for <hi>by grace wee are Å¿aved:</hi> God of his free
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:150587:104"/> grace hath pardoned us our Å¿innes, and thus are wee quickned that are dead. Now if our life lies upon our pardon, and wee be no better than Å¿o many dead men without it, doth it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us to looke about us, and to get our pardon? Is there any thing of that concernement that our life is? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> in that caÅ¿e urges them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46, 47. <hi>And hee Å¿aid unto them, Å¿et your hearts unto all the words which I teÅ¿tifie among you this day, which yee Å¿hall command your children to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve to doe all the words of this Law. For it is not a vaine thing for you: becauÅ¿e it is your life, and thorow this thing yee Å¿hall prolong your dayes in the land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee goe over Jordan to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e it.</hi> So in this, Å¿et your hearts upon this buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and make it the greateÅ¿t of all your care to get pardon of Å¿inne; it is not a vaine thing, nor a trifling buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, it is your very life. If yee get not your pardon yee dye, yee periÅ¿h, yee are undone unto eternity. When a man is condemned to dye, if he have any friends that can doe any thing with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150587:104"/> thoÅ¿e about the King, hee Å¿ets them all on worke, and there is great medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, great and earneÅ¿t Å¿uing, no paines nor coÅ¿t Å¿pared, riding and poaÅ¿ting to and againe. Now what is the reaÅ¿on of all this adoe? BecauÅ¿e the mans life lyes upon the Kings pardon, if that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e be not plyed and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the man dyes, and is Å¿ure to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: And therefore life lying on it, no marvell hee beÅ¿tirres himÅ¿elfe, and Å¿ets his wits and his friends on worke with all their might. It is our caÅ¿e if Å¿inne unpardoned, wee are but <hi>dead men,</hi> and undone men, our life lyes upon Gods <hi>mercy</hi> in our <hi>pardon:</hi> And our life lying upon it, how doth it concerne us to beÅ¿tirre our Å¿elves, and to give our hearts no reÅ¿t till wee have prevailed with God for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the <hi>taking away of our iniquity.</hi> Our life Å¿tands in our Salvation, our life Å¿tands in our Redemption, our life Å¿tands in our Reconciliation to God: And all theÅ¿e Å¿tand in the pardon of our Å¿innes. Our Salvation Å¿tands in it, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.77. Where the end of <hi>John
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150587:105"/> BaptiÅ¿ts</hi> going before the face of the Lord is Å¿aid to be, <hi>To give knowledge of Å¿alvation unto his people, by the remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of their Å¿innes.</hi> As a man is Å¿aid to bee Å¿aved when the Kings pardon comes. Our Redemption Å¿tands in it, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.7. <hi>In whom wee have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his blood, the forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿ins.</hi> We may talke of ChriÅ¿ts blood, and redemption by him, but redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee have none, and benefit of ChriÅ¿t wee have none, till wee have the pardon of our Å¿innes. Our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God Å¿tands in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in ChriÅ¿t reconciling the World, not imputing their Å¿innes.</hi> And therefore Å¿ince our Salvation, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, our Reconciliation Å¿tands in it, our life Å¿tands in it: And Å¿ince our life lyes upon it, it ought to be our greateÅ¿t care above all things to get the pardon of our Å¿innes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is the in let to all other mercy, and that which uÅ¿hers in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give us good.</hi> They muÅ¿t pray for good to be given. I but <hi>your
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150587:105"/> iniquities with-hold good things from you, Jer.</hi> 5.25. Therefore their firÅ¿t petition is, Take away all iniquity: So that wee can looke for no good to be <hi>given,</hi> till Å¿inne be <hi>forgiven:</hi> And when Å¿inne is forgiven, then that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that with-holds good from us, and then way is made, and the paÅ¿Å¿age cleered for the entrance of good. And therefore when God intends any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or a Å¿peciall good to a people, hee firÅ¿t makes way for it by the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their iniquity: Hee prepares a way for his bleÅ¿Å¿ings by the pardon of our Å¿innes: So when God intended the mercy of peace and liberty to his Church, deliverance from the Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, Å¿ee what hee doth withall, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Speake comfortably to her that her warfare is accompliÅ¿hed,</hi> all her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions Å¿hall have an end. I but alas, might they Å¿ay, wee have Å¿o many Å¿innes, and Å¿o great guilt upon us, that wee cannot hope to have that comfort. Therefore Å¿ee what followes, an anÅ¿wer to that objection, <hi>That her iniquity is pardoned;</hi> As if hee Å¿hould
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:150587:106"/> Å¿ay, I will take away your iniquities, and Å¿o make way to that mercy; your Å¿innes Å¿hall be pardoned, and Å¿o Å¿hall be no hindrance to you. And Å¿o when the palÅ¿ey man came to bee healed, what was it that made the way to that mercy. So Å¿oone as ChriÅ¿t Å¿ees him, hee Å¿ayes not Sonne be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thy palÅ¿ey is cured, but <hi>Be of good comfort, thy Å¿innes are forgiven thee,</hi> and then when that is done, then <hi>AriÅ¿e take up thy bed, and walke:</hi> The pardon of Å¿inne made way for the cure of his palÅ¿ey And Å¿o <hi>David</hi> makes that the in-let of his bodily health, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Who forgives all thine iniquities, who heales all thy diÅ¿eaÅ¿es. Davids</hi> diÅ¿eaÅ¿es were healed, and what made way for the healing of them, <hi>who forgives all thine iniquities.</hi> Pardon of Å¿inne makes way for this bleÅ¿Å¿ing. See <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 38.17. where King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth it had made way for the Å¿ame to him; <hi>Behold,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>for peace I had great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, but thou haÅ¿t in love to my Å¿oule, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it from the pit of corruption: for thou haÅ¿t caÅ¿t all my Å¿innes behinde thy
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150587:106"/> backe.</hi> Nay, for health to an whole Land, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The inhabitant of the Land Å¿hall not Å¿ay, I am Å¿icke.</hi> The Land Å¿hall be free from contagious, infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, peÅ¿tilentiall, epidemicall diÅ¿eaÅ¿es. That's a great bleÅ¿Å¿ing, but what Å¿hall make way for Å¿uch a mercy? <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that dwell therein Å¿hall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> And therefore when <hi>David</hi> Å¿ets himÅ¿elfe to praiÅ¿e God for being a God that heard prayer, hee makes this the ground of it, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 65.2. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed be thy name that haÅ¿t heard my prayer. Oh,</hi> how could God heare thy prayer when thou hadÅ¿t many Å¿innes, which <hi>covered God with a cloud, that thy prayer Å¿hould not paÅ¿Å¿e thorow,</hi> as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44. <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> It is true, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 3. <hi>Mine iniquities had prevailed againÅ¿t mee,</hi> and they had kept good things from mee, and brought evill things upon mee; but yet for all that <hi>God heard my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and to make way for hearing my prayer, <hi>As for our tranÅ¿greÅ¿sions thou Å¿halt purge them away,</hi> and Å¿o make way for hearing prayer, and doing mee good.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:150587:107"/>
                  <p>This Å¿hould be a Å¿trong motive to us, to get our Å¿innes taken away, and pardoned. Wee Å¿tand in need of good to be given us daily. To have the GoÅ¿pel and peace continued, it is a wonderfull great good and happineÅ¿Å¿e, to have the land healed, and the plague removed, and Å¿tayed from riÅ¿ing and Å¿preading, it is a good wee begge of God, and faine would have it. There is a way to have it, and to have God give us this good, but men doe not, will not take the courÅ¿e to get this good. If our Å¿innes were pardoned, God would give this good of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the GoÅ¿pell, and peace: If our Å¿innes were pardoned, God would give this good of good and Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable weather; would give this good of healing the Land, and Å¿taying the plague. Now then, as we would have God doe theÅ¿e things for us, Å¿o let us get the <hi>pardon</hi> of our Å¿innes. We pray for theÅ¿e mercies, if wee would have them, let us take heed that our iniquities prevaile not againÅ¿t us: And as wee would not have our iniquities
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150587:107"/> prevaile againÅ¿t our prayers, Å¿o let our firÅ¿t care be to have them <hi>purged away,</hi> and <hi>pardoned.</hi> Wee may pray for Å¿uch mercies as wee neede, wee may pray for the Å¿taying and removing of the plague till our hearts ake, and we Å¿hall never prevaile, Å¿o long as our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties prevaile againÅ¿t us: And they will prevaile againÅ¿t us to bring on the plague, and other judgements, if wee doe not get them pardoned. So long as the people of the Land have not <hi>their iniquities forgiven them,</hi> wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke for it that the inhabitants of of the Land, of the Citie, Å¿hould not Å¿ay <hi>we are Å¿icke.</hi> But Å¿o long as wee get not Å¿inne pardoned, Å¿o long as that reignes untaken away, Å¿o long we Å¿hall Å¿ay wee are Å¿icke, that our Townes and Cities are Å¿icke of the plague of peÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; <hi>Behold, I will bring it heatlh and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveale unto them the abundance of peace and truth. And I will cleanÅ¿e them from all their iniquity whereby they have Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againÅ¿t mee: and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have Å¿inned,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150587:108"/> and whereby they have tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t me, Jer.</hi> 33.6.8. That's the way to get health and cure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is that which Å¿eaÅ¿ons and Å¿weetens all other mercies, comforts and contentments wee enjoy, which makes all mercies Å¿weet, which makes all comforts Å¿avoury. The want of pardon imbitters all comforts, and makes a mans Å¿oule abhorre them all. Looke upon a man that is in diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e of conÅ¿cience, under the Å¿enÅ¿e of Gods anger, and in feare of condemnation; what joy and contentment takes that man in any thing hee hath, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, houÅ¿es, lands, wealth, riches, what comfort takes hee in them all? It is with a man in this caÅ¿e, as it was with that of <hi>Haman, EÅ¿th.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. <hi>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how hee had advanced him above the Princes, and Å¿ervants of the King. Haman Å¿aid moreover, Yea, EÅ¿ther the Queene did let no man come in with the King unto the banquet that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:150587:108"/> Å¿hee had prepared but my Å¿elfe, and to morrow am I invited unto her alÅ¿o with the King. Yet all this availeth mee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Å¿o long as I Å¿ee Mordecai the Iew Å¿it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Kings gate.</hi> All gave him no content Å¿o long as <hi>Mordecai Å¿ate at the Kings gate.</hi> So here, though a man have all theÅ¿e comforts, and be up to the chin in them all, yet will a mans conÅ¿cience that wants pardon, be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Å¿peaking thus if it be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I have Å¿uch and Å¿uch comforts, yet all this availes me not, Å¿o long as Å¿inne lyes before the doore, Å¿o long as my Å¿inne lyes unpardoned. I Å¿tand in a Å¿tate of guilt and wrath, and what know I but I Å¿hall goe to Hell, and bee damned, and Å¿o long as my condition is Å¿uch, what am I the better for houÅ¿e, land, wife, children, what tell you me of riches, and wealth, and theÅ¿e trifles, when Gods curÅ¿e and vengeance hangs over my head, and is ready for ought I know to fall upon mine head every moment, and to arreÅ¿t me, and drag me to hell, there to be in torment for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? But then <hi>mercies</hi> are <hi>mercies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:150587:109"/> then they are Å¿weet indeed, when they come Å¿wimming to us in the Å¿treame of ChriÅ¿ts blood, when they come with a pardon in their hand. <hi>Behold,</hi> Å¿ayes <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Ziba, Thine are all that pertained to MephiboÅ¿heth;</hi> Take thou all his lands; and Å¿ee how hee anÅ¿wers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4. <hi>I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eech thee that I may finde favour in thy Å¿ight, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee Å¿hould Å¿ay, I had rather have the Kings favour than the Lands, what good will the Lands doe mee, unleÅ¿Å¿e I may have the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. So in this caÅ¿e, it is the favour of God in the pardon of Å¿inne that Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars all outward comforts. See <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Comfort yee my people, &amp;c. Say unto her that her warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿hed.</hi> Is that all? No, <hi>And that her iniquity is pardoned.</hi> It is a comfort to have peace, liberty, freedome from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, moleÅ¿tations and oppreÅ¿Å¿ions; I but then it is a comfort indeed, and then it is Å¿weet indeed, when it comes with the pardon of Å¿inne. When the conÅ¿cience hath peace with God, then there is comfort, great comfort in

But marke, ChriÅ¿t Å¿ayes not, Be of good comfort, thou Å¿halt have thine health, that hee tells him after hee Å¿hall have, but <hi>be of good comfort thou Å¿halt have thy pardon.</hi> To teach, that then health and recovery is a Å¿weet comfort, when a mans Å¿inne is pardoned. <hi>Give us our bread, forgive our Å¿ins,</hi> teaching us, that there is little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in having bread without pardon; and that, that which makes bread com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and Å¿weet, is when it comes with pardoning mercy. A man that lyes in priÅ¿on and is a condemned man, cloath him with rich apparell, feed him with delicious fare, let him have the Å¿weeteÅ¿t MuÅ¿icke, yet Å¿o long as he is a condemned man, and lookes every houre to be fetcht out to execution, all this gives him no content: His heavy heart puts the MuÅ¿icke out of tune, takes away the relliÅ¿h of his dainty foode: But if now a pardon might
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150587:110"/> but come from the King to Å¿uch a man, this would make the MuÅ¿icke Å¿weet, the fare pleaÅ¿ant indeed: Nay, though hee had nothing but bread and water, yet a pardon would Å¿o rejoyce him that hee would thinke his bread and water good cheere, it would turne his water into wine. This is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that crownes all other mercies, it is a crowning and the chiefe of all other. <hi>David, PÅ¿al.</hi> 21. <hi>Had a crowne of pure Gold Å¿et upon his head.</hi> But when <hi>David</hi> comes to bleÅ¿Å¿e God for all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 103. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿e the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Hee Å¿ayes not, which hath Å¿et a crowne of pure gold upon thine head, but <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 4. <hi>Who crownes thee with loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e and tender mercies.</hi> Hee bleÅ¿Å¿es God for crowning him with mercy, tender mercy; for Å¿etting, not a crowne of gold, but a crowne of mercy upon his head. But how did hee Å¿et it on his head, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 2. <hi>Who forgives all thine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity. Pardoning</hi> mercy is <hi>crowning</hi> mercy, and <hi>David</hi> more joy'd in that than in his crowne. A crowne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon is but a crowne of thornes.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:150587:110"/> 
                     <hi>Davids</hi> greateÅ¿t comfort is in his crowne of loving kindneÅ¿Å¿e and tender mercies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is that which fits for duty, for the duties of praying, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> receiving of the Sacrament. A man is never fit for any duty till his Å¿innes be pardoned. So long as a man Å¿tands guilty before God, as hee doth till Å¿in be pardoned, all his duties are turned into Å¿inne. That's an heavie impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 109.7. <hi>Let his prayer become Å¿inne.</hi> But marke the ground of it, and how it comes about. <hi>When he Å¿hall be judged let him goe out guilty, and let his prayer become Å¿inne.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man Å¿tands guilty, then his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er becomes Å¿inne; and every man whoÅ¿e Å¿in is not pardoned Å¿tands guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The perÅ¿on being in his Å¿inne, hee turnes his duties into Å¿inne. Not only <hi>the plowing of the wicked is Å¿inne, Prov.</hi> 21.4. but the praying of the wicked is Å¿inne. Plowing is an <hi>honeÅ¿t</hi> worke, and praying is an <hi>holy</hi> worke; but Å¿inne unpardoned marres both plowing and praying, turnes the <hi>honeÅ¿t</hi> worke
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:150587:111"/> of plowing, and the <hi>holy</hi> worke of praying into Å¿inne. It is bad enough, and Å¿ad enough, that a man Å¿innes when hee Å¿weares, that his oathes are Å¿innes, how much more Å¿ad is it, that a man Å¿innes when hee prayes, that his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are Å¿innes. That is the Å¿ad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every man who Å¿tands guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hath not his Å¿inne pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>The end of all duties is communion with God: And a man is never fit for a duty, till hee be fit to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and communion with God: And a man is never fit for fellowÅ¿hip and communion with God, till his Å¿innes be pardoned, and Å¿o never fit for duty, till Å¿inne be pardoned. There is no fellowÅ¿hip and communion to be had with God, Å¿o long as there is a Å¿epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene God and us. Now a mans Å¿innes unpardoned, Å¿et God and us at a diÅ¿tance, make a Å¿eparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lords hand is not Å¿hortened, that it cannot Å¿ave: neither is his eare heavie, that it cannot heare. But your iniquities
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150587:111"/> have Å¿eparated between you and your God, and your Å¿innes have hid his face from you that he will not heare.</hi> As if hee Å¿hould Å¿ay, therefore ye pray and God heares you not, yee pray and yee have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowÅ¿hip with, nor anÅ¿wer from God, becauÅ¿e your Å¿innns are upon you, and they being unpardoned Å¿eparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and God, and they hide his face from you; In vaine doth a man Å¿eeke communion with God, when Å¿eparated from him: Sinne unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned makes the Lord a Å¿eparatiÅ¿t, he will not joyne with us, nor have any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowÅ¿hip with us in any of our duties. Till Å¿inne be Å¿eparated from us, God will Å¿eparate, and then Å¿inne is Å¿epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when it is pardoned, and when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned then fit for duty, becauÅ¿e then Å¿o qualified as God will have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us.</p>
                  <p>Wee are never fit for duty till wee can Å¿o doe duty, that wee may expect good from duty: Then fit for prayer, the Word, the Sacrament, when Å¿o qualified as that we may receive good from God in them, and by them: And
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:150587:112"/> that is then when wee have our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties taken away, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give good.</hi> Why pray wee but that God may give good by that ordinance? Why heare wee but that God may give good by that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? Why receive wee the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but that God may give good by that Ordinance. I but if wee will receive good by theÅ¿e, wee muÅ¿t be fit to pray, heare, receive, let us be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified aright, and God will give good. But what is that qualification? <hi>Take away all iniquity, and give good.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men doe theÅ¿e, and no good is given them, becauÅ¿e they firÅ¿t take not a courÅ¿e to have iniquity taken away: Prayer would give good, preaching would give good, and the Sacrament would give good, if wee would come fitted for theÅ¿e duties; and this is the maine thing that muÅ¿t firÅ¿t be had to fit us, the <hi>pardon</hi> of Å¿inne.</p>
                  <p>No duty is accepted till a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on be: No mans perÅ¿on is accepted Å¿o long as he is in his guilt: hee is in his guilt that hath not Å¿inne pardoned;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:150587:112"/> but when Å¿inne is pardoned, then guilt is taken off; when guilt is taken off, then a mans perÅ¿on is accepted; when a mans <hi>perÅ¿on</hi> is accepted, then his <hi>duty</hi> is accepted: A man is never fit for <hi>duty</hi> till hee be Å¿uch an one as may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and can never be <hi>accepted</hi> till his Å¿innes be <hi>pardoned.</hi> When a man comes to God in any holy duty, and comes in his guilt, in his Å¿innes, Satan is preÅ¿ently ready to put in a barre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t him, and to lay his Å¿innes in his diÅ¿h, that God may not regard him. Lord here is a man prayes, heares, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, Lord reÅ¿pect not his Å¿ervice, let him have no acceptance, nor anÅ¿wer from thee. I but why Satan? Lord hee is a Å¿wearer, a drunkard, uncleane, covetous, hee hath committed Å¿uch and Å¿uch Å¿innes, and the guilt of them yet lyes upon his Å¿oule: And wilt thou have communion with guilty Å¿inners? Art not thou <hi>a God of purer eyes then to behold iniquity?</hi> And this is a Å¿trong plea, and will carry meate in the mouth of it, Å¿o long as Å¿inne is unpardoned. There is no way to enervate Satans
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:150587:113"/> pleas, but by getting Å¿inne pardoned; that is it alone which will take off the edge of all his accuÅ¿ations. Our <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> will never be of force, Å¿o long as his <hi>accuÅ¿ations</hi> be of force: His accuÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be of force, and will enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the prevailing of our prayers, Å¿o long as Å¿inne is unpardoned: But when once Å¿inne is pardoned, then God hath to anÅ¿wer Satan with all. It is true Satan that this man that now prayes, &amp;c. hath committed Å¿uch Å¿ins as thou accuÅ¿eÅ¿t him, and thoÅ¿e Å¿innes of his deÅ¿erve that hee Å¿hould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but yet thoÅ¿e Å¿innes of his Å¿hall not prejudice his prayers, nor be any Å¿topping to my bleÅ¿Å¿ing, for I have pardoned all thoÅ¿e Å¿innes of his, they are all taken away and forgiven. Doe but conÅ¿ider that place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1. <hi>There is JoÅ¿hua Å¿tanding before the Angel of the Lord,</hi> that is, before ChriÅ¿t; Å¿tanding, that is, miniÅ¿tring in, and executing his office, offering up Å¿acrifices and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the people.

What was the ground of his accuÅ¿ations? Wherein lay their Å¿trength? That appeares, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Now IoÅ¿hua was cloathed with filthy garments.</hi> That is, he was guilty of divers Å¿innes, as <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 4. opens it, <hi>And hee anÅ¿wered, and Å¿pake unto thoÅ¿e that Å¿tood before him, Å¿aying, Take away the filthy garments from him.

                  <p>So that all this conÅ¿idered, what a motive Å¿hould it be to make us get our pardon. As wee would not have all our duties to be turned into Å¿innes; as wee would have communion with God in them all; as wee would get
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150587:114"/> good by, and in them all; as wee would have our duties accepted, and prevalent; as wee would bee fit to pray, &amp;c. Å¿o get the pardon of our Å¿innes. What a Å¿ad thing is it to loÅ¿e all our endeavours, to loÅ¿e our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hearing and receiving; all is loÅ¿t, and is loÅ¿t labour, if wee come unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them.

It is but a delicacy that men dreame of, to divide ChriÅ¿t and his CroÅ¿Å¿e: A man cannot <hi>take</hi> one, but hee muÅ¿t reÅ¿olve to <hi>take up</hi> the other. Now no man can Å¿uffer unleÅ¿Å¿e hee be fit for it, and well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Å¿ervice.

Hee that will Å¿uffer, muÅ¿t be free from cowardiÅ¿e of Å¿pirit. Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Å¿o cowes a mans Å¿pirit as the feare of Hell and damnation. Many a man could looke death in the face, that dares not looke Hell in the face. Many a man that Å¿hrinkes not at <hi>dying,</hi> yet Å¿hrinkes at <hi>damning,</hi> that quailes the Å¿touteÅ¿t courage in the world. And there is nothing that puts a man more in the feare of Hell than guilt, the want of the pardon of Å¿inne. And nothing that makes a man feare Death more, then when through death hee Å¿ees Hell, when hee Å¿ees the gates of death open into Hell; and then a man Å¿ees Hell through death, when hee apprehends his Å¿inne unpardoned; and Å¿eeing Hell through death, hee is Å¿o affrighted at the Å¿ight of Hell, that if hee can Å¿hift it hee will not dye, but will redeeme himÅ¿elfe from death upon any termes: Hee will doe any thing, yeeld to any thing, be of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:150587:116"/> of any faith, rather than Å¿uffer death for the true Religion, becauÅ¿e if hee dye, his Å¿innes being unpardoned, hee knowes there is no way but Hell for him. Thus doth Å¿inne <hi>unpardoned</hi> unfit a man to dye for ChriÅ¿t, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned Å¿inner dreads the <hi>fire,</hi> becauÅ¿e it may but prepare him for <hi>a worÅ¿e</hi> fire in Hell.</p>
                  <p>But now when a mans Å¿inne is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his conÅ¿cience diÅ¿charged of the guilt, his heart is quit of all feare of Hell and damnation: Hee Å¿ees the gates of death open into Heaven, into happineÅ¿Å¿e. And Death is not dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor terrible at all when the doore opens that way. There is nothing Å¿o animates a man, Å¿o Å¿ills his heart with courage and reÅ¿olution, as <hi>pardon</hi> of Å¿inne doth. That is it which alone makes a ChriÅ¿tian Souldier valorous, that takes paleneÅ¿Å¿e out of the cheekes, whiteneÅ¿Å¿e out of his Liver, cowardiÅ¿e out of his heart; Å¿uch <hi>have their feete Å¿hod with the preparation of the GoÅ¿pell of peace,</hi> as it is <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 6.15.</p>

                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> it is an excellent and Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preparative for death. There is no man but muÅ¿t die, and there is nothing Å¿o much concernes a man, as to be fit, and prepared to dye. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to dye, and after death comes
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:150587:117"/> judgement, Heb.</hi> 9. After death comes Judgement, and as a mans death is, Å¿o is his judgement, <hi>As the tree falls Å¿o it lyes:</hi> Such as a mans <hi>death</hi> is, Å¿uch is his <hi>doome.</hi> If a man dye with his Å¿innes pardoned, then hee is judged to life; if a man dyes without pardon, then his judgement is without mercy, hee is judged to death, and Å¿entenced to Hell. InaÅ¿much therefore as a man is never fit to dye comfortably, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, till death Å¿hall make way for him into Heaven, and a man cannot looke for any entrance into Heaven till hee be pardoned his Å¿inne, therefore till a mans Å¿inne be pardoned, hee is never fit to dye. See how <hi>Job</hi> Å¿peakes, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.21. <hi>Why doeÅ¿t thou not pardon my Å¿in, and take away mine iniquity;</hi> As if hee Å¿hould Å¿ay, Oh Lord be not hard to be entreated, let mee prevaile with thee for the pardon of my Å¿inne. But why is <hi>Iob</hi> Å¿o earneÅ¿t for the pardon of his Å¿inne? See what followes, <hi>for now Å¿hall I Å¿leep in the dust;</hi> As if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, Now Lord I am upon the point of death, and looke for no other but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150587:118"/> to dye; and alas, how Å¿ad will my condition be, if I Å¿hould dye without my pardon. Since I muÅ¿t dye, Lord fit and prepare me for a comfortable death by the pardon of my Å¿inne.</p>
                  <p>Then is a man fit to dye, when the time after death Å¿hall prove a time of refreÅ¿hing: Times of refreÅ¿hing come after the pardon of Å¿inne, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Peter</hi> to the men of IÅ¿rael, <hi>and be converted, that your Å¿innes may be blotted out, when the times of refreÅ¿hing Å¿hall come from the preÅ¿ence of the Lord.</hi> And then the times after death are times of <hi>refreÅ¿hing,</hi> when the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death are times of <hi>remiÅ¿sion.</hi> Hee hath prepared himÅ¿elfe well for death, that hath taken order that the time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, Å¿halbe a refreÅ¿hing time; and that order onely hee takes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death hath taken order for the pardon of his Å¿innes.</p>
                  <p>Then a man is fit to dye, and never till then, when the Å¿ting of death is taken out, Å¿o as death can doe a man no hurt, when <hi>death</hi> Å¿hall not be <hi>deadly</hi> to him. There is a Å¿peech, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.23.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150587:118"/> 
                     <hi>I will kill her children with death.</hi> Some men are kill'd with death, they doe not onely dye, but they are kill'd with death, Death proves deadly to them. All men <hi>dye,</hi> but all men are not <hi>killed</hi> with death. As a godly man Å¿aid that hee did <hi>agrotare vitaliter,</hi> Å¿o godly men they doe <hi>mori vitaliter:</hi> When a man can dye Å¿o, then hee is fit to dye.</p>
                  <p>Now whence is it that death becomes deadly? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>The Å¿ting of death is Å¿inne.</hi> Sinne onely makes death deadly. That which armes death to doe hurt, is Å¿inne. It is as in that caÅ¿e, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.10. The LocuÅ¿ts there had a power to hurt men with their <hi>Scorpion-like tailes, and their Å¿tings in thoÅ¿e tailes, and their power was to hurt men five moneths.</hi> So death hath a power to hurt men, but that power is from men themÅ¿elves; Sinne it is that gives this power to Death to doe a man hurt.</p>
                  <p>In Death there be two things:</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Å¿ting</hi> of death. That is the power it hath of delivering men over to the curÅ¿e of God and eternall wrath: And it is this Å¿ting that makes it deadly. It may Å¿trike a man with the hand, as it doth all godly men, and yet not be deadly, but then deadly when it Å¿trikes with a Å¿ting, and makes way for a mans Å¿eparation from God for ever. And this power Å¿inne onely gives death. It is Å¿inne <hi>unpardoned</hi> and <hi>unforgiven</hi> that gives death this power
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:150587:120"/> to deliver a man over to wrath, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him in chaines to Hell. This is to be killed with Death. Now a man can never be fit to dye, but when he is willing; And never can hee bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Å¿o long as hee Å¿ees Death with a Å¿ting. The onely way to fit a man for death, Å¿o as to be willing to dye, is to get out the Å¿ting. The way to get out the Å¿ting, is to get Å¿inne pardoned; <hi>pardoned Å¿inne</hi> makes death <hi>without a Å¿ting,</hi> and then it is not terrible. A Fly makes as great an humming as a Bee, and yet wee feare not a Fly as a Bee, becauÅ¿e a Fly hath no Å¿ting. Wee are fit to dye when wee feare not Death.</p>
                  <p>This of all other Å¿hould make us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿ollicitous for our pardon. <hi>Death is the King of terrours,</hi> and it is a Å¿ad thing at the time of death to have the heart full of feares, the conÅ¿cience full of horrours, to have death looke gaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in our faces. Get pardon, and free from all this.</p>
                  <p>Dye thou muÅ¿t, that's once. Now if one Å¿hould come and tell us, you Å¿hall
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150587:121"/> dye in a Gaole, you Å¿hall dye in a ditch, wee Å¿hould thinke it a Å¿ad hearing, it would Å¿ound dolefully in our eares. I but there is a Å¿peech of ChriÅ¿ts to thoÅ¿e, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21.24. that Å¿ounds more dreadfully then the former, <hi>Yee Å¿hall dye in your Å¿innes.</hi> It is a Å¿ad thing to dye in a Gaole, to dye in a ditch, but this is the Å¿ad thing indeed, yee Å¿hall dye in your Å¿innes. In a Gaole, in a ditch a man may dye, and yet goe to Heaven, but the man that dyes in his Å¿innes, a dead Dogge is better then he, <hi>It had beene good for that man that hee had never beene borne.</hi> To dye in ones Å¿innes, it is to drop downe right into Hell. It is dangerous to <hi>live</hi> in ones Å¿innes, becauÅ¿e a man may dye in them, but it is more dangerous to <hi>dye</hi> in them, becauÅ¿e no way but Hell with Å¿uch a man. Take heede what ever ye doe, and looke to it, that when you come to dye, yee doe not dye in your Å¿innes. And the way not to dye in your Å¿innes, is not to live in your Å¿ins, but to get the pardon of them while yee live. This is the happineÅ¿Å¿e of a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150587:121"/> man whoÅ¿e Å¿innes are pardoned, that being once pardoned as <hi>hee will not live</hi> in them, Å¿o being once pardoned <hi>hee Å¿hall never dye</hi> in them. It is a Å¿weet thing to dye as <hi>Stephen</hi> did,<note place="margin">Act. 6.56.</note> 
                     <hi>to Å¿ee Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened, &amp;c.</hi> to dye with the Å¿enÅ¿e of Gods love and favour. Some when they dye they Å¿ee Hell opened, and the Devils Å¿tanding about their beds ready to drag them to the place of torment: It is hideous dying Å¿o: which of theÅ¿e two deaths would wee now chooÅ¿e? If yee would not dye the laÅ¿t, get Å¿inne pardoned, that yee may not dye in your Å¿innes. None can at their death, with <hi>Stephen,</hi> Å¿ee Heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that have not firÅ¿t gotten their Å¿ins pardoned,</p>
                  <p>It is impoÅ¿Å¿ible that a man Å¿hould have peace and comfort in his end, that dyes <hi>without Å¿inne taken away</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. When death once arreÅ¿ts a man, then conÅ¿cience if it be awake will bring in and lay to a mans charge all his Å¿innes, and Satan will be buÅ¿ie to lay on loade, and to affright a man with Hell and damnation. If a debtor
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:150587:122"/> be arreÅ¿ted and caÅ¿t into priÅ¿on, it is no Å¿ooner heard of, but every creditor comes in and brings in his Å¿everall actions, and loades him with executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such is the caÅ¿e of an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿inner at his death. So Å¿oone as death doth arreÅ¿t him, Satan comes in, conÅ¿cience comes in, yea and God himÅ¿elfe comes in, all come in with their actions againÅ¿t him, and what peace or comfort can there be in Å¿uch a condition. But if Å¿inne before-hand be pardoned, all this trouble is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and a man dyes in peace. It is a rule that Å¿uch as are about dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons live by, that when a man is dying, nothing Å¿hould be done that might trouble him in his departure, that there be no Å¿hrieking or crying out, none will offer to pull off the clothes, to plucke away his bed from under him, becauÅ¿e they will have him dye qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, wee will not have a dying man diÅ¿turbed and diÅ¿quieted. Now how much more Å¿hould every one have a care, that when hee comes to dye, hee may dye quietly, that hee may not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150587:122"/> heare the cryings and Å¿hriekings out of conÅ¿cience, nothing will diÅ¿turbe a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man as will they. If then men would goe quietly out of the world, let them get the <hi>pardon</hi> of their Å¿inne: If that be not pardoned, there is little hope of departing in peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> Since therefore it is a thing Å¿o much to be looked after; how may a man get his iniquity taken away, and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> Two things muÅ¿t be done to get pardon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> wee muÅ¿t be taken off from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Å¿uch falÅ¿e principles as make us regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e of pardon, that keepe us from looking after, and labouring for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Two falÅ¿e principles there are that kill endeavours after pardon, and make men careleÅ¿Å¿e in looking after it. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> that it is an eaÅ¿ie thing to be had at pleaÅ¿ure, a man may have it with a wet finger at any time when wee will, that it may be had at the low rate of a <hi>Lord have mercy upon mee,</hi> when there is Å¿carce breath enough in a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Å¿peake theÅ¿e five words. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:150587:123"/> that it is an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility to get pardon of Å¿inne, and that it is a thing cannot be had. Both theÅ¿e principles, though contrary to each other, make men careleÅ¿Å¿e in looking after pardon, and in taking paines to get <hi>iniquity ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</hi> Who will be anxious, Å¿olli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, induÅ¿trious? who will take care and paines all the dayes of his life to be getting that, hee may have when he will for five words Å¿peaking? Who againe will beÅ¿tow time and paines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which hee conceives impoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible to bee effected. No man will Å¿et a teame of horÅ¿e to remove a feather, becauÅ¿e when hee liÅ¿t hee can remove it with a Å¿light puffe of his breath: No man alÅ¿o will Å¿et a teame of horÅ¿e to remove a mountain, becauÅ¿e he knowes it is an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility: So that whileÅ¿t men either conceive it Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to bee had, or Å¿o impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be had, it layes a bed all cares and endeavours after pardon. Therefore on the contrary we muÅ¿t know theÅ¿e two things. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> that it is not Å¿o eaÅ¿ie a thing to get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as men imagine; it is an hard
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:150587:123"/> thing to get pardon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that, though it be hard, yet it is poÅ¿Å¿ible and may be had. It is hard, yet poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible; it is poÅ¿Å¿ible, and yet hard; and hardneÅ¿Å¿e of obtaining and poÅ¿Å¿ibility, are the two quickners of cares and endeavours, to obtaine any good thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> then wee muÅ¿t learne that it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not Å¿o eaÅ¿ie a thing to get a pardon, but that the worke is a difficult, and an hard worke. A worke that a man muÅ¿t tug, and Å¿weat at, that will coÅ¿t him a great deale of care, a great deale of trouble and contention of Å¿pirit, a great deale of paines and diligence, before it can be brought about.</p>
                  <p>That it is not Å¿o eaÅ¿ie a thing as men dreame of, to get the pardon of Å¿inne, appeares by that Å¿peech of <hi>Peters</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Repent thee of this wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> Hee doth not intimate an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility of getting his pardon, for then why Å¿hould hee preÅ¿cribe him a courÅ¿e to Å¿eeke it; if hee had meant it had beene impoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150587:124"/> in vaine had hee adviÅ¿ed him to repent; but his meaning is to Å¿hew him that his pardon would not eaÅ¿ily be had, but that it would bean hard, a very hard thing, though a poÅ¿Å¿ible thing to be obtained; As if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, I will not deny but it is poÅ¿Å¿ible, but yet if thou wilt ever have it, it will coÅ¿t thee tugging and Å¿weating for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon Magus</hi> indeede was naught, and therefore his pardon might Å¿eeme the harder to be gotten, but yet if wee looke upon good men, wee Å¿hall finde that they have found it hard enough to obtaine. See how <hi>David</hi> labours and wreÅ¿tles for it, <hi>PÅ¿al</hi> 51.1, 2. <hi>Have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c. blot out. WaÅ¿h mee. CleanÅ¿e me.</hi> This iteration, and ingemination of his Å¿uite, that hee thus pulls and tugs for it, implies how hard hee found it to get pardon. LeÅ¿Å¿e labour and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Å¿pirit would have Å¿erved the turne if it would Å¿o eaÅ¿ily have beene had.</p>
                  <p>See how difficult a work <hi>Job</hi> found it, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20, 21. <hi>I have Å¿inned, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.7, 8. <hi>Agur would beg for his pardon, and labour to get that even to his dying day.</hi> It is a thing, a worke that will take up all a mans life, it will finde him buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e to his dying day, to get the pardon of Å¿inne. It is a mans whole life time, well Å¿pent too, if hee Å¿peed in that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e. Alas, if it were a work Å¿o eaÅ¿ily done as many dreame, what needed <hi>Agur</hi> have Å¿pent Å¿o much time about it? why could hee not follow the world, and follow his luÅ¿ts, and take his pleaÅ¿ure as hee Å¿aw good,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:150587:125"/> and then when hee was ready to dye, when hee was at his laÅ¿t gaÅ¿pe, have fetcht his pardon from Heaven, with a Lord have mercy upon mee? why Å¿ayes he not, One thing I would have of thee, which I will beg when I dye, when I am dying, <hi>Remove from mee all my guilt?</hi> No, <hi>Agur</hi> knew that pardon was not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily purchaÅ¿ed, hee knew it was a great worke, and an hard work and therefore would be Å¿ure to take time enough to doe it; hee Å¿aw it was worke enough for his <hi>whole life;</hi> and therefore would not make it his worke <hi>at his dying day,</hi> but till his dying day. This one thing Å¿hewes the difficulty of the pardon of Å¿inne, to conÅ¿ider what God doth on his part. On Gods part, for our pardon is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> not onely mercy and grace, but great and wonderfull grace and mercy, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Mercy, tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, multitude of tender mercies, PÅ¿al.</hi> 86.5. <hi>Ready to forgive.</hi> I but it is out of mercy that hee forgives. And what will any mercy Å¿erve the turne?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:150587:125"/> No, <hi>ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy.</hi> So that unto forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e is required, not onely mercy, not any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common mercy, but plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mercy.

From <hi>God who is rich in mercy.</hi> Therefore to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Å¿inne is required not only grace and mercy, but riches of Grace, riches of Mercy. And God in the pardon of a Å¿inner, layes forth the riches of his mercy, the riches of his grace. When a rich man gives a poore man an almes, hee gives him Å¿omewhat of his riches, but brings not out his whole riches, layes not out his treaÅ¿ures upon him. <hi>Riches is an abundance of things pretious.</hi> But now God in pardoning a Å¿inner layes out his treaÅ¿ures and riches, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿.</hi> 2.7. <hi>That hee might Å¿hew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of his grace.</hi> Now Å¿ome pence, Å¿ome Å¿hillings are not Å¿o hard to be had, common mercies of food and rayment, preÅ¿ervation, theÅ¿e be but

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> not onely power and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> might, but his infinite power, his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 99.8. <hi>Deus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, &amp;, condonans eis,</hi> not onely is hee a mercifull God forgiving, but hee is a Å¿trong God in forgiving, not onely his <hi>infinite mercy,</hi> but his <hi>infinite power</hi> is required, and hath a concurrence in the pardon of Å¿inne. And therefore Å¿ee <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 86.5.8. <hi>No God like him, no works like his;</hi> as being of God, of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power as to pardon Å¿inne. And therefore hence that Å¿ame <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iniquity, and paÅ¿Å¿eth by the tranÅ¿greÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the remnant of his heritage? hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not his anger for ever, becauÅ¿e hee
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:150587:126"/> delighteth in mercy.</hi> So that to pardon Å¿inne is as great a worke as to Å¿hake heaven and earth, yea as to make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth. Is it an eaÅ¿ie thing to Å¿hake heaven and earth? It cannot be done but by an Almighty power; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it cannot be done but by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power: Therefore it is not an eaÅ¿ie worke; and therfore by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on no eaÅ¿ie worke to have Å¿inne pardoned, becauÅ¿e an Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is required thereto.</p>
                  <p>So then, wee Å¿ee that it is no Å¿uch eaÅ¿ie thing to get pardon. Now theÅ¿e things are not Å¿poken to diÅ¿courage and diÅ¿hearten men from Å¿eeking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but to quicken and awaken men to take paines for it. Slothfull and lazie endeavours will never get things that be hard and difficult. The harder things are to be gotten, the harder muÅ¿t men labour to get them. There is no diÅ¿couragement in the difficulty of obtaining pardon, becauÅ¿e though it be hard, yet,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is poÅ¿Å¿ible, and the worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> feaÅ¿able. All the paines in the world
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150587:127"/> will not effect impoÅ¿Å¿ibilities. But though things be hard and difficult, yet Å¿o long as poÅ¿Å¿ible, there is roome for, and encouragement to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:150587:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> It is idle to pray for impoÅ¿Å¿ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, if it had beene an impoÅ¿Å¿ible thing, it had beene weakely done of <hi>David</hi> to have prayed for that which could not have been. Prayer is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon promiÅ¿es, all things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed are things poÅ¿Å¿ible. So then, though it be an hard thing, yet being poÅ¿Å¿ible, it being a poÅ¿Å¿ible thing, yet an hard thing, Let it make us Å¿hake off both all Å¿lothfulneÅ¿Å¿e out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>eaÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and all deÅ¿pondencie of Å¿pirit out of a conceit of the <hi>impoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibility</hi> of obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> theÅ¿e falÅ¿e principles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Å¿et upon the meanes by which it may be had. And they are theÅ¿e:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> Faith in the blood of ChriÅ¿t. There is no pardon to be had without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> blood.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:150587:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the blood of buls and goats Å¿hould take away Å¿innes.

God promiÅ¿es <hi>to give a white Å¿tone to him that overcomes, Apoc.</hi> 2.17. to give the pardon of Å¿inne. A man muÅ¿t be waÅ¿hed in ChriÅ¿ts blood, and waÅ¿hed white in that before hee can have that white Å¿tone given him. It is then ChriÅ¿ts blood that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity.</p>
                  <p>But now this blood takes not away unleÅ¿Å¿e this blood be applyed. It wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hes white, but yet there muÅ¿t be <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing</hi> before there can be <hi>whiteneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:150587:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> Therefore the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peakes not onely of blood, but of the <hi>Å¿prinkling of the blood of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. It is not enough that there be the blood of ChriÅ¿t, and that hee hath Å¿hed it, but there muÅ¿t be beÅ¿ides the Å¿hedding of it, the Å¿prinkling of it. ChriÅ¿ts blood was Å¿hed upon the CroÅ¿Å¿e, and yet all mens Å¿innes are not pardoned; and what is the reaÅ¿on? BecauÅ¿e though his blood were Å¿hed on the CroÅ¿Å¿e, yet that blood is not Å¿prinkled upon their hearts and conÅ¿ciences: And pardon muÅ¿t be had, not onely from blood Å¿hed, but from blood Å¿prinkled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 51. <hi>Purge mee with hyÅ¿ope;</hi> it was the blood that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but yet it was the hyÅ¿ope that Å¿prinkled the blood: It muÅ¿t be Å¿prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled blood that muÅ¿t be purging blood: So it muÅ¿t be ChriÅ¿ts blood Å¿prinkled upon the conÅ¿cience that muÅ¿t <hi>take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity.</hi> Well, but how comes ChriÅ¿ts blood to be Å¿prinkled upon the conÅ¿cience? It is true that ChriÅ¿t Å¿prinkles his blood upon a Å¿inner, <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will Å¿prinkle cleane water upon

Wee muÅ¿t not Å¿huffle off all to ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿ay, It is hee that muÅ¿t Å¿prinkle us with his blood, and if hee will but Å¿prinkle me, then my Å¿inne Å¿hall be pardoned. But if wee will have our iniquity taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, wee muÅ¿t beÅ¿prinkle our Å¿elves. Lay theÅ¿e two Texts together, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Hee hath waÅ¿hed us from our Å¿innes in his own blood. Apoc.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have waÅ¿hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lambe.</hi> So that not onely ChriÅ¿t waÅ¿hes, but they alÅ¿o themÅ¿elves waÅ¿h with ChriÅ¿ts blood: And therefore it is that men are called upon to waÅ¿h themÅ¿elves, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 1.15. <hi>WaÅ¿h you, make you cleane.</hi> It is cleere therefore that Å¿ome way men muÅ¿t have an hand in waÅ¿hing and Å¿prink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themÅ¿elves with ChriÅ¿ts blood, if they will have pardon.</p>
                  <p>But now, how may a man waÅ¿h and beÅ¿prinkle himÅ¿elfe? That is done by faith and by beleeving in ChriÅ¿t.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:150587:129"/> Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>through faith in his blood.</hi> Faith is the hand of the Å¿oule, and the Å¿oule by faith puts her hand into ChriÅ¿ts blood, puts her hand into the wounds of ChriÅ¿t, takes there of his blood, and beÅ¿prinkles her Å¿elfe, and waÅ¿hes, and wrinces off her guilt and defilement. Faith taking ChriÅ¿ts blood, and beÅ¿prinkling the Å¿oule with it, applying it unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, thereby is iniquity taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>ChriÅ¿ts blood is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine opened for Å¿inne, viz.</hi> to take away Å¿inne and iniquity. God opens that Fountaine, and there is an healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in that Bath to purge and cure the Å¿oule from guilt. But now though there be an healing vertue in the Bath, yet a man cannot be healed unleÅ¿Å¿e hee will goe into the Bath. <hi>When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel moved in the waters at the poole of BetheÅ¿da, there was Å¿ome healed,</hi> but not <hi>every one that was diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed,</hi> but <hi>hee that firÅ¿t Å¿tept in.</hi> Men might have lyen long enough in the porches of <hi>BetheÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> looking on the water and motion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150587:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Å¿till have beene as leprous and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as before, but hee that would be healed muÅ¿t Å¿tep in, muÅ¿t plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe into the poole. So ChriÅ¿ts blood that fountaine is opened to take away Å¿inne, but it is not lying by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor looking onely upon the fountaine, but it is Å¿tepping into the fountaine, and wrincing, and waÅ¿hing in that fountaine that takes away Å¿inne. Now faith is that by which a man goes into that fountaine, by which hee waÅ¿hes and wrinces himÅ¿elfe in that fountaine, by which hee plunges and douzes himÅ¿elfe in the poole, and Å¿o gets off his guilt.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that in Scripture we are Å¿aid to have pardon by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>Through this man is preached unto you,</hi> and Å¿o offered unto you, <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes.</hi> I, it is offered to us in him, but how Å¿hall we come by it? <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 39. <hi>And by him all that beleeve are juÅ¿tified from all things, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 9.2. <hi>hee Å¿eeing their faith, viz.</hi> The palÅ¿ey mans as well as the other, <hi>Å¿aid unto the Å¿icke of the palÅ¿ey, Sonne be of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:150587:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> good comfort thy Å¿innes are forgiven thee. Luc.</hi> 7.48, 49, 50. <hi>And hee Å¿aid unto her, thy Å¿innes are forgiven. And they that Å¿ate at meate with him, began to Å¿ay within themÅ¿elves, Who is this that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth Å¿innes alÅ¿o? And hee Å¿aid to the Woman, Thy faith hath Å¿aved thee, goe in peace.</hi> There is then the way to get iniquity taken away. Faith layes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleevers Å¿innes upon ChriÅ¿t, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Å¿cape goate, and he as the Å¿cape goate beares and carries them away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a land of Å¿eparation. Thus then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion is had by blood, by the blood of ChriÅ¿t, by his blood Å¿hed, by his blood Å¿prinkled upon us, by faith in his blood, by faith Å¿prinkling and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing us with the blood, by faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his blood and merit to our Å¿elves. So then, if wee would get Å¿in <hi>taken away,</hi> wee muÅ¿t get <hi>faith</hi> in ChriÅ¿ts blood, and Å¿trive, and wreÅ¿tle hard to beleeve. It is a very hard thing to beleeve in ChriÅ¿ts blood. A great many thinke it eaÅ¿ie to beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, and the truth is, that it is eaÅ¿ie to beleeve as they doe, they come ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ily
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:150587:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> by their faith that it may well be queÅ¿tioned whether they come ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly by it or not. As therefore wee ever deÅ¿ire to have our Å¿innes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Å¿o never give wee our Å¿oules reÅ¿t till wee have gotten true faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. So long as you live and goe on in your unbeleefe, it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to have the pardon of Å¿inne. <hi>Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not the wrath of God abideth on him, Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> There is no pardon Å¿o long as under wrath. So long as <hi>in unbeleefe,</hi> Å¿o long <hi>under wrath, Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>To the unbeleeving all things are unclean, their conÅ¿ciences being defiled.</hi> So long then as a man is in unbeleefe, Å¿o long hee is defiled, becauÅ¿e Å¿inne being not pardoned the guilt thereof defiles his conÅ¿cience and his perÅ¿on. How many be there that have had the pardon of Å¿inne preached to them, and offered to them in the GoÅ¿pel in the Name of ChriÅ¿t, and yet to this day their Å¿innes are upon them, and <hi>not taken away?</hi> And what is the reaÅ¿on of it? BecauÅ¿e they are not Å¿prinkled with ChriÅ¿ts blood. And why not? BecauÅ¿e they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:150587:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> want an hand of faith to take the blood of ChriÅ¿t which is Å¿hed, and to Å¿prinkle it upon their owne conÅ¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And Å¿o for want of faith they have all their Å¿innes lye unpardoned upon their Å¿oules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> repentance for Å¿in. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is no pardon to be had without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As there is a faith unto life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.47. <hi>Hee that beleeveth on mee hath life:</hi> And <hi>a juÅ¿tification of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. So there is <hi>a repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, Act.</hi> 11.18. And as the Lord ChriÅ¿t is a Saviour, Å¿o hee is a <hi>Prince, Act.</hi> 5.13. And to what end is hee both? <hi>A Prince and Saviour for to give repentance to IÅ¿rael and forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne.</hi> Hee indeede gives forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne, but hee alÅ¿o gives repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yea and hee gives repentance that he may give pardon: And where hee intends the latter, hee workes the former. <hi>David</hi> begs <hi>to have his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity taken away.</hi> God hee promiÅ¿es to take away another thing, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will take away the Å¿tony heart out of your fleÅ¿h.</hi> It is a Å¿ure thing that they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:150587:132"/> that will have <hi>iniquity</hi> taken away, muÅ¿t have the <hi>Å¿tony heart</hi> taken away; they that will have the <hi>Å¿ting</hi> taken out of their heart, muÅ¿t have the <hi>Å¿tone</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their heart, hee gives repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiÅ¿sion of Å¿innes, when he gives remiÅ¿sion hee takes away the Å¿ting, when hee gives repentance hee takes away the Å¿tone; and he firÅ¿t takes away the Å¿tone before hee removes the Å¿ting. And therefore ChriÅ¿t joynes both theÅ¿e together in the commiÅ¿sion hee gives his ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.47. <hi>And that repentance and remiÅ¿sion be preached in his Name.</hi> They that preach remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion in ChriÅ¿ts Name, and preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in his Name, they muÅ¿t firÅ¿t preach <hi>repentance</hi> before they preach <hi>remiÅ¿sion.</hi> All to teach that they muÅ¿t have repentance that will have remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, and that repentance is a Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes to get the pardon of Å¿inne.</p>
                  <p>And therefore wee Å¿hall Å¿ee that the promiÅ¿es of pardon are made to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that when God promiÅ¿es to give pardon of Å¿inne to any hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:150587:132"/> it to Å¿uch as are Å¿o conditioned and Å¿o qualified with repentance. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. There is the promiÅ¿e of <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Å¿hall be opened for Å¿inne,</hi> that is, to take away the Å¿inne of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi> I, but that fountaine is yet unto the Jewes a Å¿ealed fountaine, their iniquity is not taken away, they yet lye under their guilt: But yet there is a promiÅ¿e of <hi>a day</hi> when that Å¿ealed fountaine Å¿hall be broken up, and Å¿hall be opened. But what day is it? <hi>In that day.</hi> In what day? It hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that which goes before in the former chapter. See <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 10, 11. &amp;c. <hi>They Å¿hall looke upon me whom they have pierced,</hi> that is, they Å¿hall beleeve in ChriÅ¿t whom they crucified, <hi>And</hi> upon it <hi>they Å¿hall mourne for him, &amp;c.</hi> They Å¿hall repent for that Å¿inne of the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ChriÅ¿t, and the murder of him, <hi>In that day there Å¿hall be a great mourning in JeruÅ¿alem, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>in that day Å¿hall a fountaine be opened to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of JeruÅ¿alem.</hi> In that day then that <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> Å¿hall mourne, <hi>in that day</hi> Å¿hall the fountaine be opened
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:150587:133"/> to <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> for Å¿inne. <hi>Oh that mine head,</hi> Å¿ayes <hi>Ieremy, were as a fountaine of teares.</hi> When their heads and hearts Å¿hall be opened as a fountaine of teares to mourne for their Å¿innes, then Å¿hall the fountaine of ChriÅ¿ts blood be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for their Å¿innes. When they Å¿hall waÅ¿h themÅ¿elves in the fountaine of <hi>teares of repentance,</hi> in that day will God waÅ¿h them in the fountaine of <hi>Christs blood.</hi> The day of repentance is the day of pardon, in that day a Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repents, in that day God pardons, and takes away iniquity.</p>
                  <p>There is no queÅ¿tion but the Lord lives by his owne rule which he gives us to live by. The rule hee gives us to live by is that <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>If hee repent forgive him, if hee treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t thee Å¿even times, yet if he Å¿ay, I repent, you Å¿hall forgive him.</hi> As upon a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers repentance wee muÅ¿t forgive, Å¿o upon our repentance God will forgive: Repent and thy brother muÅ¿t forgive, and repent, and God will forgive. Alas what are <hi>our mercies</hi> to the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God?</hi> Gods mercies are an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:150587:133"/> a boundleÅ¿Å¿e bottomleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ea of mercies, our mercies are but Å¿mall drops out of this Sea. Now if God do binde us that have but poore, Å¿mall, and a few drops to be thus mercifull, as upon repentance to forgive them, then Å¿urely the Lord whoÅ¿e mercies are as the waters of the Sea, that cover the earth, upon our repentance will give us pardon, or elÅ¿e our drops Å¿hould do more than his Sea, and hee Å¿hould binde us to doe more with our drops of water, then hee will doe with his whole Sea. Surely as mans power, wiÅ¿dome, juÅ¿tice, cannot exceed Gods, Å¿o neither can mans mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ions goe beyond his. He that will have a treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿er againÅ¿t man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned upon his repentance before man, hee will pardon a treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿er a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t God upon his repentance before him.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoÅ¿e alÅ¿o are thoÅ¿e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Come now, &amp;c.</hi> Now: When? <hi>WaÅ¿h you make you cleane, &amp;c.</hi> and then <hi>come, and though your Å¿innes be as Scarlet, &amp;c.</hi> Scarlet is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:150587:134"/> a deepe dye, a dye that will hold, a dye that will not eaÅ¿ily be fetcht out, not eaÅ¿ily made white: And yet God promiÅ¿es to turne Å¿carlet colour into Å¿now colour, Å¿carlet into white. It is eaÅ¿ie to turne white into Å¿carlet, but not Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to turne Å¿carlet into white. And yet God will doe it. Hee will waÅ¿h them with the Å¿carlet blood of ChriÅ¿t, and that Å¿hall turne their Å¿car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let into white. Other blood dyes and Å¿taines what is waÅ¿hed in it, but ChriÅ¿ts blood takes out Å¿taines, and makes white, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.14. <hi>TheÅ¿e are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waÅ¿hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lambe.</hi> I, but when will God thus change their Å¿carlet white, when will hee take away their iniquity? Then when they were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed and made cleane, &amp;c. Upon the condition of their repentance hee would give them the pardon of their Å¿innes. And upon the Å¿ame condition is the Å¿ame promiÅ¿e; <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forÅ¿ake his way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man his thoughts, and let him returne
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:150587:134"/> unto the Lord, and hee will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for hee will abundantly pardon;</hi> hee will multiply to pardon.</p>
                  <p>And wee finde that God upon Å¿uch condition hath made good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I acknowledged my Å¿inne unto thee: and mine iniquity have I not hid: I Å¿aid, I will confeÅ¿Å¿e my tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿sions unto the Lord, and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿t the iniquity of my Å¿inne.</hi> That is, I did repent and humble my Å¿oule in the confeÅ¿sion of my Å¿inne, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveÅ¿t the iniquity of my Å¿inne: Not that repentance fetches in pardon by way of merit, as monie buyes pardons at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor yet that repentance layes hold on pardon, which is the worke of faith alone. But for two reaÅ¿ons par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don followes upon repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> BecauÅ¿e the faith that lookes on ChriÅ¿ts blood, lookes at the Å¿ame time on its owne Å¿inne, and every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Å¿inner is at the Å¿ame time a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Å¿inner, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They Å¿hall Å¿ee him whom they have pierced, and they Å¿hall mourne.</hi> So that faith not

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the want of aÅ¿Å¿urance of pardon doth no leÅ¿Å¿e diÅ¿quiet the heart then the want of pardon it Å¿elfe. Now Å¿uppoÅ¿e a man upon his faith have his pardon, yet hee cannot bee aÅ¿Å¿ured of it till hee doe repent. Upon repentance God gives the aÅ¿Å¿urance, and Å¿eales it to the conÅ¿cience: And therefore upon repentance it is that pardon is promiÅ¿ed.</p>
                  <p>So then, would wee have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Å¿inne, would wee have iniquity taken away? See then what is to be

As thou wouldeÅ¿t have <hi>pardon,</hi> Å¿o fall cloÅ¿e to the taske of <hi>repentance:</hi> So humble thy Å¿elfe for thy Å¿innes, mourne and be in bitterneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿pirit; judge thy Å¿elfe and turne from thy Å¿innes, and God will then Å¿hew mercy to thee in thy pardon. So long as thou liveÅ¿t and lyeÅ¿t in thy Å¿innes, and goeÅ¿t on in thine impenitency and hardneÅ¿Å¿e of heart, thou canÅ¿t not have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor the hope of pardon of thy Å¿inne.</p>
                  <p>You have many that hope their Å¿ins are pardoned, and that God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away their injquity; and why Å¿o? Why they thanke God they beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, and that with all their hearts. It is well if they doe Å¿o. But yet they that will have pardon muÅ¿t <hi>repent</hi> as well as <hi>beleeve:</hi> You thanke God you beleeve, but in the meane time where is your repentance. <hi>Though I had all faith Å¿o as I could remove mountaines, and yet have not love, I am nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. So in this caÅ¿e, though thou hadÅ¿t all faith Å¿o as thou couldeÅ¿t remove mountaines, yet if you want repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:150587:136"/> in this caÅ¿e thou art nothing; thou haÅ¿t not, nor canÅ¿t have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at Gods hand. Thou Å¿ayeÅ¿t thou beleeveÅ¿t, and therefore thou hopeÅ¿t thou haÅ¿t thy pardon. I, but the faith that helpes to pardon, is a <hi>repenting</hi> and a <hi>mourning</hi> faith. Thy faith is no Å¿uch faith. Thou Å¿ayeÅ¿t thou beleeveÅ¿t; I, but yet thou art a drunkard, a Å¿wearer, an uncleane, a covetous perÅ¿on. Thy faith is a Å¿wearing faith, thy faith is a drunken faith, thy faith is a whoring faith, a covetous faith. Now doeÅ¿t thou thinke that a whoring, drunken, Å¿wearing faith, is a faith that will help thee to the pardon of thy Å¿inne? No Å¿uch matter. <hi>In that day a fountaine Å¿hall be opened for Å¿inne, Zech.</hi> 13.1. But in what day? <hi>They Å¿hall Å¿ee him whom they have pierced, and they Å¿hall mourne and be in bitterneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> Not Å¿imply in that day when they have a faith to Å¿ee him, but in that day when they Å¿hall Å¿ee him, and mourne for him; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e is not made to any faith, but to a mourning faith, to a repenting faith. Doe but marke that paÅ¿Å¿age, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:150587:136"/> 
                     <hi>Then Simon himÅ¿elfe beleeved alÅ¿o, yea and was baptized, and continued, and kept company with Philip.</hi> Here was a faith that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had: But Å¿ee <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 22. <hi>Repent thee of this thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> and <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 23. Therefore there is a faith that men may have, and yet they may be guilty of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, there is a faith that men may have, and yet be in the gall of bitterneÅ¿Å¿e, yet be in the bonds of iniquity: And Å¿uch a faith will not Å¿erve for pardon, but if men will have pardon, they muÅ¿t repent of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿e: The faith that muÅ¿t helpe to the pardon of Å¿inne, muÅ¿t be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting faith. And though thou talke of faith, whileÅ¿t thine heart akes, yet if thy faith be not a mourning, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith, thy Å¿innes are not pardoned, thine iniquity is not taken away, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcomes I will give a white Å¿tone,</hi> that is, I will give him the pardon of his Å¿inne, as a white Å¿tone was a token of abÅ¿olution and diÅ¿charge to a man queÅ¿tioned for his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:150587:137"/> life. So long as men live in their Å¿ins, they are all blacke and filthy, they are Ethiopians in their blacke skins. Doe you thinke that God will give the white Å¿tones to Å¿uch as have blacke Å¿oules? They muÅ¿t be white that will have the white Å¿tone. How Å¿hall men become white? <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.39. <hi>They Å¿hall be afflicted,</hi> that they may bee brought to <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>Å¿o be made white.</hi> Repentance makes white, and when men are made white by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then God gives them the white Å¿tone, Å¿eales to them the pardon of their Å¿innes. Therefore as ever wee deÅ¿ire to get the pardon of Å¿inne, Å¿o be wee humbled, and repent for Å¿inne.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if pardon of Å¿inne bee a thing Å¿o much to be looked after, and of Å¿uch concernement, then give thy Å¿oule no reÅ¿t till thou haÅ¿t gotten aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of Å¿inne, and till thou knoweÅ¿t that thy Å¿inne is <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> For God doth not onely pardon Å¿inne, but God aÅ¿Å¿ures a Å¿inner of his pardon, not onely gives but Å¿eales a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:150587:137"/> pardon, and this is properly the white Å¿tone, the Å¿eale and token of abÅ¿oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pardon. What is a man the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a pardon if he know it not? A condemned Malefactor may have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but Å¿o long as hee knowes it not, he is in as much feare and perplexity of Å¿pirit, as another Malefactour that hath none: There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them in regard of <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of Å¿pirit. Therefore the Lord not onely pardons Å¿inners, but when hee pardons them, hee makes it known unto them, and aÅ¿Å¿ures their conÅ¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, that Å¿o they may not onely have <hi>pardon,</hi> but <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> of Å¿pirit. Doe but conÅ¿ider that Text, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>JoÅ¿hua was there cloathed with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy garments, and Å¿tood before the Angel,</hi> before ChriÅ¿t; and <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 4. ChriÅ¿t Å¿peakes twice, hee Å¿peakes to them that Å¿tood by, and to <hi>IoÅ¿hua</hi> himÅ¿elfe. <hi>To them that Å¿tood by, hee Å¿aid, Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filthy garments from him.</hi> It is my will and pleaÅ¿ure that <hi>IoÅ¿hua's</hi> Å¿ins be taken away and pardoned. That's happy for <hi>IoÅ¿hua:</hi> But is that all? No,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:150587:138"/> he Å¿peakes a Å¿econd time. <hi>And unto him he Å¿aid,</hi> not only unto them that Å¿tood by, but unto him, unto <hi>IoÅ¿hua</hi> hee Å¿aid, <hi>Behold I have cauÅ¿ed thine iniquity to paÅ¿Å¿e from thee.</hi> So that ChriÅ¿t doth not onely <hi>pardon</hi> a Å¿inner, but gives the pardoned Å¿inner <hi>aÅ¿Å¿urance</hi> of it. There is not onely a Å¿entence of abÅ¿olution pronounced in the Court of <hi>Heaven</hi> before thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand before ChriÅ¿t, but a Å¿entence of abÅ¿olution pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Court of <hi>ConÅ¿cience.</hi> Hee not onely Å¿ayes to them that Å¿tood before him, <hi>IoÅ¿huaes</hi> Å¿inne is pardoned, but hee Å¿ayes to <hi>IoÅ¿hua</hi> himÅ¿elfe, and unto him he Å¿aid, <hi>IoÅ¿hua</hi> thy Å¿inne is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, as to the <hi>palÅ¿ey man, Be of good comfort, thy Å¿innes are forgiven thee.</hi> Therefore Å¿hould we not onely labour for pardon, but for the knowledge of it, for thereupon lyes our peace and comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> How may a man know then that his Å¿inne is pardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> BeÅ¿ides the Å¿ecret teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and witneÅ¿Å¿e of Gods Spirit Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a mans pardon to him in the very
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:150587:138"/> acts of holy duties and Ordinances, it may be knowne by theÅ¿e things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> by the mortification of Å¿inne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and the taking away the reigning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof. There is in Å¿inne a double <hi>power:</hi> There is a <hi>condemning</hi> power, and there is a <hi>commanding</hi> power, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it rules and reigns in a mans heart, Å¿o as hee is under the obedience of it. There is the <hi>guilt</hi> of Å¿inne, and there is the <hi>dominion</hi> of Å¿inne, that by which it rules in the hearts and lives of men: of the firÅ¿t yee have mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> Of the Å¿econd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sinne Å¿hall not have dominion over you.</hi> The guilt is the damning power, and the dominion is the reigning power. Now <hi>David</hi> here prayes, <hi>Take away the iniquity of thy Å¿ervant;</hi> that is, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Å¿inne. Now pardon of Å¿inne Å¿tands in the taking away of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and condemning power, and when a man knowes that the damning and condemning power of his Å¿inne is taken away, then hee may know that his Å¿inne is pardoned. But how Å¿hall a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:150587:139"/> man know that the damning power of Å¿inne is taken away? Then is the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power taken away when the reigning power is taken away: Then is the <hi>condemning</hi> power taken away when the <hi>commanding</hi> power is taken away: Then is the guilt taken away, when the dominion is taken away. WhereÅ¿oever Å¿inne is pardoned, it is Å¿inne Å¿ubdued, it is Å¿inne mortified, it is Å¿inne forÅ¿aken, and caÅ¿t off: So that if a man know his Å¿inne to be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Å¿ubdued, and know himÅ¿elfe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the reigning and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power of it, hee may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it that hee is delivered from the damning power of it.</p>
                  <p>JuÅ¿tification is called <hi>the JuÅ¿tificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18. As it is a JuÅ¿tifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life, Å¿o it may be called <hi>a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tification of Death.</hi> A juÅ¿tification of life to a mans <hi>perÅ¿on</hi> that is pardoned, a juÅ¿tification of death to a mans <hi>Å¿inne</hi> when hee is pardoned, becauÅ¿e upon the juÅ¿tification of a mans perÅ¿on fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes neceÅ¿Å¿arily the mortification of a mans luÅ¿ts: And Å¿o pardoned Å¿inne
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:150587:139"/> is deaded Å¿inne. Sinne no Å¿ooner loÅ¿es the <hi>Sword</hi> to kill, but it loÅ¿es the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to rule: and therefore if the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be loÅ¿t, the Å¿word is loÅ¿t. If the dominion be mortified, the guilt is certainely pardoned, for all dominion flowes from guilt, and it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power that enables Å¿in with a commanding power: So that if the commanding power be taken away, it is a Å¿ure Å¿igne that the condemning power is taken away, for otherwiÅ¿e the commanding power would remaine in full force and Å¿trength.</p>
                  <p>See <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paÅ¿Å¿eth by the tranÅ¿greÅ¿sion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauÅ¿e he delighteth in mercy. He will turne againe, he will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿sion on us: he will Å¿ubdue our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thou wilt caÅ¿t all their Å¿innes into the depths of the Sea.</hi> Marke then where God pardons iniquity, and caÅ¿ts Å¿innes into the depths of the Sea, there hee alwayes Å¿ubdues iniquity: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:150587:140"/> where iniquity is Å¿ubdued, there iniquity is pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Lay together thoÅ¿e two Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He Å¿hall turne ungodlineÅ¿Å¿e from Jacob,</hi> that is, hee Å¿hall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and pardon the Å¿in of <hi>Jacob.</hi> But now <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 59.20. the words lye other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, <hi>Vnto them that turne from tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿sion in Iacob.</hi> This diverÅ¿ifying of the words teaches thus much: That where ungodlineÅ¿Å¿e is turned from men, there men are turned from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineÅ¿Å¿e; where mens perÅ¿ons are <hi>juÅ¿tified,</hi> there mens luÅ¿ts are <hi>mortified;</hi> where God gives men pardon of Å¿inne, there God gives power againÅ¿t Å¿inne: And Å¿o alÅ¿o where God hath given po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, there God hath given pardon; and where men are turned from tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ion, there ungodlineÅ¿Å¿e is turned from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sinne Å¿hall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you, for ye are not under the Law,</hi> and Å¿o under guilt, <hi>but ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace,</hi> you have your Å¿innes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the grace and mercy of God. See then, that Å¿o long as under
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:150587:140"/> the Law, and under guilt, Å¿o long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of Å¿inne. That when under grace and Å¿inne pardoned, then Å¿inne hath no dominion. And that therefore when men are <hi>not</hi> under the <hi>dominion,</hi> under the commanding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Å¿inne, that that is a Å¿ure Å¿igne they are under <hi>Grace,</hi> their Å¿innes are pardoned, and they are freed from the condemning power of them.</p>
                  <p>Doe but marke that Text, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.22, 23. <hi>If it Å¿pread much abroad in the skin, then unclean, it is a plague.</hi> To teach, that if Å¿inne reigne, then a man is not pardoned, hee muÅ¿t be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced uncleane. But in the next verÅ¿e. <hi>If the Å¿pot Å¿tay in his place, and Å¿pread not, it is a bile, and the Priest Å¿hall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him cleane.</hi> Strange that a man Å¿hould have a Å¿pot, and a burning bile, and yet be pronounced cleane. Why Å¿o? BecauÅ¿e it Å¿tayes in its place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it Å¿preads not. To teach, that though men may have luÅ¿ts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which are Å¿pots in the Å¿oule, yea burning biles, yet if they Å¿pread not, reigne not, they are not imputed,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:150587:141"/> they are pardoned. Therefore where the reigning, Å¿preading, commanding power of Å¿inne is gone, there the condemning power is alÅ¿o taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>WouldeÅ¿t thou then know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy Å¿innes be taken away or no? Looke into thine heart, into thy luÅ¿ts, into thy life. Are thine iniquities Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: Art thou turned from tranÅ¿greÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion: Art thou free from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy luÅ¿ts? LuÅ¿ts thou haÅ¿t, but yet they are but <hi>burning biles,</hi> they be Å¿pots, <hi>but they Å¿tay in their place,</hi> they doe not <hi>Å¿pread:</hi> Are thy luÅ¿ts mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? be of good comfort, thy perÅ¿on is juÅ¿tified. Is the commanding power taken away? be of good comfort, the condemning power is taken away. This Å¿ayes unto thee, as ChriÅ¿t to <hi>IoÅ¿hua,</hi> I have paÅ¿Å¿ed by thine iniquity. But by this may many Å¿ee that their Å¿innes are not pardoned. If pardoned, why under the power of habituall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e, uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e? How is it that thy looÅ¿e luÅ¿ts have Å¿uch command over thee. Thy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:150587:141"/> luÅ¿ts Å¿ubdue thee, they are not Å¿ubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore not pardoned. The Å¿pot Å¿preads much abroad in thy skin, it is not a large bile, it is a plague. Thou art undone, thou art in thy guilt, thy Å¿inne is unpardoned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.5, 6. They who are <hi>waÅ¿hed in ChriÅ¿ts blood are made Kings and PrieÅ¿ts.</hi> They that are pardoned, have their iniquities Å¿o Å¿ubdued, that they reigne over as <hi>Kings,</hi> and Å¿acrifice the bed of Å¿inne in mortification as <hi>PrieÅ¿ts.</hi> But now if Å¿inne and luÅ¿t be the King, and that reigne over thee, that be the King and thou be the Å¿lave and the drudge, then art thou not waÅ¿hed in ChriÅ¿ts blood, then are not thy Å¿innes pardoned. Take it for a Å¿ure truth, that Å¿inne <hi>unmortified</hi> is Å¿inne <hi>unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Sinne in the throne is Å¿inne unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Å¿anctification of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> mans heart and Å¿pirit. When God takes away iniquity, hee furniÅ¿hes that man with all Å¿anctifying graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>I have cauÅ¿ed thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to paÅ¿Å¿e from thee.</hi> There is the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:150587:142"/> pardon of Å¿inne, <hi>And J will cloath thee with change of rayment,</hi> I will furniÅ¿h thee with the graces of Å¿anctification. That as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9, 10, 11. <hi>Then wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed I thee with water: yea, I throughly waÅ¿hed away thy blood from thee, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed thee with oyle. I cloathed thee alÅ¿o with broidered worke, and Å¿hod thee with Badgers skin, and I girded thee about with fine linnen, and I covered thee with Å¿ilke. I decked thee alÅ¿o with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and J put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chaine on thy necke.</hi> So in this caÅ¿e. So that whereÅ¿oever a man findes true Å¿anctifying grace in his heart, it is an evidence that his Å¿innes are pardoned. The love of ChriÅ¿t, and the love of God it is a grace of Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and therefore it is a Å¿igne of pardon of Å¿in. See <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I Å¿ay unto thee, Her Å¿innes which are many, are forgiven, for Å¿he loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the Å¿ame loveth little.</hi> Where the particle, for, is not cauÅ¿all, not Å¿hewing the cauÅ¿e of her remiÅ¿Å¿ion, but onely a Å¿igne of her remiÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 39. The PhariÅ¿ee
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:150587:142"/> findes fault with ChriÅ¿t for Å¿uffering a Å¿inner to be Å¿o familiar with him. ChriÅ¿ts anÅ¿wer is, Å¿hee is no Å¿inner. He proves it, becauÅ¿e her Å¿innes were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her; but how proves hee that? <hi>For Å¿he loved much:</hi> As if hee Å¿hould Å¿ay, This grace of love is an evidence that declares her Å¿inne is pardoned. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Who was before a blaÅ¿phemer, and a perÅ¿ecutor, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but I obtained mercy, becauÅ¿e I did it ignorantly, in unbeleife. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love, in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as love to God, Å¿o love to our brethren, and delight in their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Å¿ociety is made a Å¿igne of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>I will take away the iniquity of that Land, in one day.</hi> The iniquity of that Land, that is, the guilt of the Churches iniquities, for by the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was typified the Church or people of God; and this I will doe in one day, that is, by the alone and all-Å¿ufficient Å¿acrifice of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150587:143"/> ChriÅ¿t offered up once for ever. <hi>In that day, Å¿aith the Lord of HoÅ¿ts, Å¿hall ye call every man his neighbour under the Vine, and under the Fig-tree.</hi> In that day, namely, when as the people of God Å¿hould by that onely Å¿acrifice Å¿o offered up to God for Å¿inne, through the alone juÅ¿tification of faith, come to enjoy the true Å¿pirituall and inward peace themÅ¿elves, then Å¿hould they expreÅ¿Å¿e Å¿o much love and charity towards others, as to call in them who were unconverted, to come and partake of the Å¿ame good with them.</p>
                  <p>By this try: Is thy love to God, and to ChriÅ¿t, and to his Saints? A good Å¿igne. But on the contray, the unholineÅ¿Å¿e of mens hearts and lives, argues how it is with them. To have Å¿inne pardoned, is to be under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For yee are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Can a man bee under Grace, and have no grace? Can a man bee under Grace, and graceleÅ¿Å¿e? Certainely, graceleÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:150587:143"/> perÅ¿ons are not under Grace, have not their Å¿innes pardoned. Such have never yet aright Å¿ought for, much leÅ¿Å¿e obtained the taking away of their iniquity.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:150587:146"/> curÅ¿ed as a man <hi>contentious.</hi> That hath alwayes beene the lot of Gods Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Saints, to have that imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid upon them. A man may Å¿trive in his MiniÅ¿tery to bring men to repentance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>My Spirit Å¿hall Å¿trive no longer with man.</hi> Therefore Gods Spirit Å¿trives in the MiniÅ¿tery of his Å¿ervants whileÅ¿t hee Å¿ets them on to make them Å¿trive to bring men to God. <hi>And men may Å¿trive, and contend earneÅ¿tly for the faith once given to the Saints, Iude</hi> 4. And yet this makes not men, men of contention in an ill Å¿enÅ¿e. Indeed the world counts Å¿uch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men: But who they be that truly deÅ¿erve that cenÅ¿ure wee Å¿ee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. <hi>But unto them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and doe not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, indignation, and wrath.</hi> Therefore Å¿uch as doe not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the truth, but obey unrighteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, they are the contentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons. Well, but yet the Prophet muÅ¿t goe for a contentious man, and Å¿o a man odious. What's the matter? It may be hee was an uÅ¿urious oppreÅ¿Å¿or,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:150587:146"/> and therefore contentious and curÅ¿ed. Hee purges himÅ¿elfe from that, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 10. <hi>I have neither lent on uÅ¿ury, nor have men lent to mee on uÅ¿ury.</hi> Therefore it muÅ¿t be Å¿ome what elÅ¿e.

And that hee opens more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 16. for thy Å¿ake it is, for <hi>thy words were found by mee, and I did eate them.</hi> I have beene faithfull when I found what thy word and will was, to diÅ¿perÅ¿e and practiÅ¿e it, and hence is all this adoe, therefore the clamours and curÅ¿es are againÅ¿t mee. BecauÅ¿e I eate thy Word, therefore it is that they are ready to eate up mee, and to devoure mee. That is the dependance of theÅ¿e words. And wee may take this by the way from it. <hi>That the true ground of all clamours, curÅ¿es, reproaches againÅ¿t Gods Å¿ervants, is nothing elÅ¿e but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:150587:147"/> this, tbeir conÅ¿cientious and cloÅ¿e wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God, and walking by the rule of his Word.

                  <p>For the words themÅ¿elves, and their Å¿enÅ¿e. <hi>Thy words were found by mee,</hi> that is, thou didÅ¿t reveale and make known thy Word and will to mee. <hi>And I did eate them.</hi> It is a <hi>metaphor</hi> by which hee expreÅ¿Å¿es with what readineÅ¿Å¿e and forwardneÅ¿Å¿e hee received the Word either to diÅ¿perÅ¿e it to others, or for his owne practiÅ¿e and obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> with Å¿uch readineÅ¿Å¿e and affection, as an hungry man would doe his meate, I was as willing to diÅ¿perÅ¿e, and obey thy Word, as if thou hadÅ¿t commanded mee to have eaten meat when hungry.</p>

                     <hi>made knowne to us, must be eaten of us.</hi> It is not enough to heare the Word, to reade the Word, but wee muÅ¿t eate the Word. That which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did in a Å¿peciall caÅ¿e peculiar to them, that muÅ¿t wee all doe; <hi>Eze.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Moreover, he Å¿aid unto me, Sonne of man, eat that thou findeÅ¿t: eate this roule, and goe, Å¿peake unto the houÅ¿e of IÅ¿rael. So I opened my mouth, and hee cauÅ¿ed me to eate that roule. And he Å¿aid unto me, Sonne of man, cauÅ¿e thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I give thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth, as hony for Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> So <hi>John, Apoc.</hi> 10.9. <hi>And J went unto the Angel, and Å¿aid unto him, Give mee the little Booke. And hee Å¿aid unto mee, Take it and eate it up, and it Å¿hall make thy belly bitter, but it Å¿hall be in thy mouth as Å¿weet as honey.</hi> So wee, when we finde the Word muÅ¿t eate it. There muÅ¿t be a manducation, a comeÅ¿tion of the Word.</p>
                  <p>As the body hath its food, Å¿o the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:150587:148"/> Å¿oule alÅ¿o. Now for the body, it is not enough to Å¿ee food, and looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, nor to feele food, and to handle it, nor to Å¿mell food, but if the body will be nouriÅ¿hed and maintained in life, it muÅ¿t eate food, and take it in; Å¿o likewiÅ¿e the Å¿oule <hi>having</hi> its food, and the Word <hi>being</hi> its food, it is not enough to heare it, and receive it in at the eare, but it muÅ¿t alÅ¿o eate it, and take it in at the mouth.</p>
                  <p>The Word is <hi>milk,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. <hi>I have fed you with milke:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not enough for men to have milke amongÅ¿t them, but they muÅ¿t be fed with it, and they muÅ¿t feed upon it. And how can men feed unleÅ¿Å¿e they eate?</p>
                  <p>The Word is <hi>bread, Amos</hi> 8.11. <hi>A famine not of bread, but of the Word,</hi> that is, a famine not of bodily, but of Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bread: Therefore it is Å¿prituall bread. And what more uÅ¿uall then this Scripture phraÅ¿e of eating bread. Bread is appointed, and made for that uÅ¿e and end to be eaten. Bread may be in the houÅ¿e, may be on the table,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:150587:148"/> may be in a mans hand, and yet if a man eate it not, hee is never the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor fuller, nothing can Å¿atisfie a mans hunger, or keep life up, but the eating of bread.</p>
                  <p>The Word is <hi>hony, PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.103. And of this hony may it bee Å¿aid as <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.16. <hi>HaÅ¿t thou found Hony? eat Å¿o much as is Å¿ufficient for thee:</hi> or as <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.13, 14. <hi>My Å¿on, eat thou hony becauÅ¿e it is good, and the hony combe, which is Å¿weet to thy taÅ¿te. So Å¿hall the knowledge of wiÅ¿dome be unto thy Å¿oule: when thou haÅ¿t found it, then there Å¿hall be a reward, and thy expectation Å¿hall not be cut off.</hi> As wee Å¿ee <hi>SamÅ¿on, Judg.</hi> 14.8, 9. <hi>When he found hony in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keyÅ¿e of the Lion, he took thereof in his hands, and he went on eating.</hi> So when wee finde this hony, it is not onely to be lookt on, gazed on, wondred at, talkt of, but to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That Å¿hall feed you.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word is to be fed upon, and to be eaten, elÅ¿e how fed? See <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55.1, 2. <hi>Buy and eate:</hi> what is that? <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 2. <hi>hearken and eat.</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:150587:149"/> word muÅ¿t be Å¿o hearkned unto as muÅ¿t be eaten. When God gives the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word hee makes that good. <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I laid meat unto them.</hi> And when hee layes meat to us, hee lookes wee Å¿hould eate that meate. And that which wiÅ¿dome Å¿peakes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Come and eate of my bread,</hi> may without any great forcing be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto this particular, for that bread there Å¿poken of is offered in the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better conceiving of this duty, conÅ¿ider Å¿uch particulars as this metaphor implyes. ConÅ¿ider wherein this <hi>eating</hi> Å¿tands. It Å¿tands in theÅ¿e things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> in an appetite unto, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire after the word. Unto eating is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an appetite and a Å¿tomacke, it is mens appetites and hunger that Å¿ets them on eating: A man cares not for eating unleÅ¿Å¿e his appetite and Å¿tomack be up, unleÅ¿Å¿e hee be hungry. So this eating of the word implyes an <hi>appetite</hi> and a <hi>Å¿tomacke</hi> to it. When God Å¿ets this food before us, wee Å¿hould have
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:150587:149"/> our Å¿pirituall appetite, and come to it with <hi>Å¿harpe Å¿et</hi> Å¿tomackes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new borne babes deÅ¿ire the Å¿incere milke of the Word.</hi> And Å¿uch an appetite had <hi>Iob</hi> to the Word, <hi>Iob</hi> 23.12. <hi>I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teemed the words of his mouth more then my neceÅ¿Å¿ary food.</hi> Hee had it in Å¿uch eÅ¿teeme that he deÅ¿ired it more, and had a Å¿tronger appetite to it then to his neceÅ¿Å¿ary food, not onely then he had to his dainties and Å¿uperfluities, but more then to his neceÅ¿Å¿ary Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall food, without which hee could not well live and Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t. Such was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> appetite, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.20. <hi>Mine heart breakes for the longing, &amp;c.</hi> and that not at Å¿ome fits, <hi>but at all times.</hi> This good cheere never came amiÅ¿Å¿e to him, his Å¿tomacke was ever good, hee could at any time <hi>eate,</hi> and fall <hi>heartily</hi> to.</p>
                  <p>And thus did they eate the Word, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.20. when they had Å¿uch an earneÅ¿t appetite to eate the Word that ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples had not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure <hi>Å¿o much as to eate bread.</hi>

                        </gap>rd of God.</hi> And this taÅ¿ting is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under eating, for then doth a man taÅ¿te his meate when hee eates it. There is a queÅ¿tion, <hi>Job</hi> 12.11. <hi>Doth not the eare try words? and the mouth taÅ¿te his meate?</hi> And an anÅ¿wer to it, <hi>Job</hi> 34.3. <hi>The eare tryeth words, as the mouth taÅ¿teth meate.</hi> Looke as in eating the mouth taÅ¿teth meate, Å¿o in hearing the word, and in eating of it, the Å¿oule takes the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of it. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> eates the word, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.103. <hi>How Å¿weet are thy words unto my taste, Å¿weeter then hony to my mouth. David</hi> did eate the word, and in eating taÅ¿ted the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In a delight and pleaÅ¿ure in it. There is a naturall and lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaÅ¿ure that a man takes in eating, which ariÅ¿es from the taÅ¿te of his meates. The Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of meate taÅ¿ted in the eating of it, doth give a man a great deale of contentment and cheering, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.25. <hi>They did eate, and delighted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in thy great goodneÅ¿Å¿e, viz.</hi> that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:150587:151"/> goodneÅ¿Å¿e of Gods which they taÅ¿ted in the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of the creature: That goodneÅ¿Å¿e of the creature which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed a gladneÅ¿Å¿e in their hearts, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>He fills our hearts with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> So when wee are commanded to eate the word, it is required that wee heare, receive, and obey it with a delight and gladneÅ¿Å¿e of heart. So did the Prophet eate it here, <hi>J did eate them, and thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoycing of mine heart.</hi> No man takes more joy and delight in eating his food, then I doe in the <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> thy Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in chewing the Word by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> meditation, and Å¿tudy upon it. A man when hee eates, hee firÅ¿t chewes his meate before hee lets it downe. If a man gulpe or Å¿wallow his meat downe whole, hee cannot be Å¿aid properly to eate. In eating, the teeth muÅ¿t doe their office in grinding, and chewing it, and Å¿o preparing it for the Å¿tomacke. So this eating implyes the duty of Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Å¿tudy, and meditation upon the Word heard. <hi>The beaÅ¿ts that did not
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:150587:151"/> chew the cud were not cleane.</hi> In the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Word, this chewing of it by meditation is a Å¿peciall thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. There is a three-fold uÅ¿e of chewing our meate in eating of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> the grinding and chewing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the meate with our teeth expreÅ¿Å¿es and cruÅ¿hes forth the juyce and Å¿ucculency of it, and Å¿o makes a man taÅ¿te and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of it, and makes him take the more delight in eating his meate. A man that Å¿wallowes his meate whole doth not taÅ¿te that Å¿weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿avourineÅ¿Å¿e in it, becauÅ¿e the Å¿ucculency of it is not cruÅ¿hed forth. So meditation, and chewing the word it wrings and cruÅ¿hes forth the Å¿avory Å¿ucculency of the word. A man that barely heares the Word, and Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes down a whole Sermon at once, and never takes it in pieces, nor chewes it by meditation, feeles nor taÅ¿tes not that Å¿avorous delicacy and Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e in the word that others doe that chew it by meditation: And hee is <hi>Davids</hi> bleÅ¿Å¿ed man, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>WhoÅ¿e delight
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:150587:152"/> is in the Law of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> grinding and chewing the meate fits it for digeÅ¿tion and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Chewing facilitates concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chewed meate is Å¿ooner and eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier digeÅ¿ted then meate Å¿wallowed whole. Meate Å¿wallowed whole is unwholÅ¿ome, it makes the breath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿avoury, it makes concoction the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Å¿lower. And Å¿o meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prepares the word for Å¿pirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿tion. The word chewed when it is eaten, is the eaÅ¿ier brought into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> chewing meate prevents dangers, there may be pinnes, Å¿tones, yea poyÅ¿on in a mans meate, and when a man Å¿wallowes his meate whole, all theÅ¿e may goe downe undiÅ¿cerned, but when a man chewes his meate, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently findes Å¿uch offenÅ¿ive things, and puts them out, and Å¿o Å¿aves the choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and poyÅ¿oning. Nay, though neither pinnes nor poyÅ¿on in a mans meat, yet the Å¿wallowing of his meate whole, may choake him, and make him miÅ¿carry. When men after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:150587:152"/> doe chew the cud by meditation, they come to diÅ¿cerne, and finde out many things, which if they were let downe, might choake and poyÅ¿on the Å¿oule.</p>
                  <p>This then is a maine duty in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the word to chew it. The word is not rightly and kindly eaten when it is not chewed: Therefore is not the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of the Word taÅ¿ted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not the Word Å¿o kindly digeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore are many choaked and poyÅ¿oned, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿wallowed whole without chewing. One of the Symptomes, or <hi>in commoda Å¿enectutis, EcclcÅ¿.</hi> 12.3.16. <hi>The grinders ceaÅ¿e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they are few,</hi> was the margent rules, <hi>the grinders faile becauÅ¿e they grinde little.</hi> And Å¿o in this caÅ¿e, a great deale of miÅ¿carriage is in this kinde, becauÅ¿e men altogether uÅ¿e their eares, and not their teeth, the grinders faile, and they grinde little, their is much hearing, but there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meditation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In Å¿wallowing and letting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5,"/> downe the Word. If a man doe take

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:150587:154"/> meat into his mouth, and chew it, yet if hee Å¿wallow it not downe, but put it forth againe, hee cannot be Å¿aid to eate. Neither chewing without Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, nor Å¿wallowing without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is properly eating, but in eating there muÅ¿t be both chewing and Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. So in the eating of the word, it muÅ¿t not onely be heard, taÅ¿ted, chewed, but it muÅ¿t be let downe and Å¿wallowed, <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.44. <hi>Let theÅ¿e Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Å¿inke downe into your eares,</hi> and Å¿o downe into your hearts. So muÅ¿t the Word be eaten, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to eate the roule, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Sonne of man eate that thou findeÅ¿t, eate this roule.</hi> I, but how muÅ¿t hee eate it? would it Å¿erve to take it into his mouth? <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 2. <hi>So I opened my mouth, and he cauÅ¿ed me to eate the roule.</hi> Well, but would the opening of his mouth, and eating it with his mouth Å¿erve the turne? No, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 3. <hi>Sonne of man cauÅ¿e thy belly to eate, fill thy bowels with this roule that I give thee.</hi> So in the eating of the Word delivered to us, it is not enough to take it into our mouths, but we muÅ¿t
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:150587:154"/> Å¿wallow it downe, cauÅ¿e our belly to eate it, and not onely fill our eares, our heads, &amp; memories, but we muÅ¿t fil our bellies, and our bowels with it. This is done when wee not onely heare and meditate upon it, but when it is Å¿o di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿ted, and concocted by us, that wee by obedience and conformity to it even become one vvith it; As vvhen meate is eaten and digeÅ¿ted, it becomes one vvith the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the body. This point of eating is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Yee have obeyed from the heart that forme of doctrine whereunto ye were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> That looke as meate eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one with the body, and takes the Å¿ame forme with it; Å¿o then is the Word eaten when we yeeld Å¿uch obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, as that we are delivered into the forme of the Word. And this is indeede the maine and principall thing in this eating: And till this be done the Word is not eaten. Many have a conceit that they eate the Word, becauÅ¿e they heare, take Å¿ome delight in it, &amp;c. but in the mean while they yeeld not obedience to it, bring
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:150587:155"/> it not into practiÅ¿e, it is in their eares, it is in their mouthes, it is in their note Bookes, but it is not in their bellies, and bowels. It is juÅ¿t with them as in that caÅ¿e with thoÅ¿e. <hi>JÅ¿a.</hi> 29.8. <hi>As an hungry man dreames, and behold he eates</hi> as in his dreame, hee dreames he eates, <hi>but he awakes, and his Å¿oule is empty.</hi> And Å¿o many, they dreame they eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they heare, &amp;c. but yet their Å¿oule is empty, and their belly is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauÅ¿e they never cauÅ¿ed their belly to eate, they never filled their bowels, the Word never yet Å¿anke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts to worke them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it.</p>
                  <p>And thus in theÅ¿e things Å¿tands this duty of eating, and this is the duty that wee are to doe. And that we may be Å¿tirred up to it, conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:</p>

                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> eating the Word, it is both the meanes and the Å¿igne of Å¿piritiuall life. It is the meanes of life. Eating maintaines life, let a man give up ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hee muÅ¿t give up living; no eating, no life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.15. <hi>Give us

And when once men leave eating, it is a Å¿igne they are neere dying, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 107.18. <hi>Their Å¿oule abhorreth all manner of meate: and they draw neere to the gates of death.</hi> It is a Å¿igne men are in a dying condition when once they are paÅ¿t eating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e eating is the meanes of preÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of life. So it is here, eating the Word is the meanes of Å¿pirituall life.

A dead man cannot eate, onely living men eate, and when men eate and fall hard to their meate, it is a Å¿igne that they are alive, and their health good. When men can eate, and fall hard to the Word, it is a Å¿igne that they are in life and health.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which moved <hi>Eve</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> eate the forbidden fruit, Å¿hould move us to eate the commanded fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>And when the Woman Å¿aw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaÅ¿ant to the eyes, and a tree to be deÅ¿ired, to make one wiÅ¿e, Å¿he tooke of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and did eate, and gave alÅ¿o unto her husband with her, and he did eate.</hi> So here, the word is good, good for food,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:150587:157"/> it is that which is to be deÅ¿ired to make one wiÅ¿e, therefore let us take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and eate heartily of it. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of the Word is that which Å¿hould move to eate. Good meate tempts men to eate, and though men have no great Å¿tomacke, yet if they heare meat commended for good meate, they will eate of it, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Hearken, and eate that which is good.</hi> And it is <hi>Salomons</hi> argument, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Heare yee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the inÅ¿truction of a father: and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know underÅ¿tanding.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Men Å¿tand much upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> taking and eating the Sacramentall bread, and put not a little in the eating of it, but in the meane time make little regard of eating the Word. They would take it very ill if they Å¿hould be kept from eating Sacramentall bread, and yet in the meane time willingly and voluntarily abÅ¿taine from eating the bread of the Word: Therefore let men know that there is a greater neceÅ¿Å¿ity of eating the Word then is of eating the Sacrament. A man may be Å¿aved if hee eate not the Sacramen, but a man cannot be Å¿aved if hee eate not the Word. It may fall out that a man cannot have the Sacrament, but yet if a man doe eate the Word, in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e the not eating of the Sacrament Å¿hall be no prejudice to him. And beÅ¿ides how ever men conceive of their eating bread in the Sacrament, yet the truth is, that a man is never fit, nor prepared to eate the Sacrament, till hee doe firÅ¿t eate the Word. The
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:150587:158"/> Word not firÅ¿t received, beleeved, and obeyed, a man hath no right to, and Å¿hall have no benefit by eating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for he that eates not the word cannot eate ChriÅ¿t in the Sacrament; and what is a man the better for <hi>eating</hi> the Sacrament, if hee <hi>eate</hi> not ChriÅ¿t? <hi>They did all eate of the Å¿ame Å¿pirituall meat, and yet with many of them God was not well pleaÅ¿ed.</hi> And why Å¿o? becauÅ¿e though they did eate Manna a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, yet they did not eate the Word, and yeeld obedience from the heart to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 5.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that which <hi>David</hi> did, wee ought all to doe, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.11. <hi>I have hid thy Word in mine heart.</hi> It is to be hid and kept Å¿afe. There is no Å¿uch way to hide it, and lay it up Å¿afe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as to eate it. Bodily bread, as <hi>Bernard</hi> Å¿ayes, when it is in the cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, it may bee taken away by theeves, eaten of mice, may mould, and be waÅ¿ted, but when it is eaten it is Å¿afe from all Å¿uch danger: So the Word is never Å¿o Å¿afely hid as when once it is eaten. After the miracles of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:150587:158"/> the loaves, our Saviour bids <hi>gather up the fragments, and Å¿ee,</hi> Å¿ayes he, <hi>that nothing be loÅ¿t.</hi> The onely way to Å¿ee that nothing of this bread be loÅ¿t, is to eate it. It is never loÅ¿t that is eaten.</p>

                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> if people muÅ¿t eate the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Word, then they muÅ¿t give them to eate. How can they eate, that have nothing to eate? <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The young children aske bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</hi> In Å¿uch a caÅ¿e they might aske bread, but they could not eate bread; where bread was not given, bread could not be eaten. Many would eate bread if they had it. And that people have it not, and eate it not, it is the fault of Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters as give it not, and breake it not. Many keepe their people at Å¿uch Å¿hort commons, that they have not to eate, Å¿o farre from having their bellies full, that they get not Å¿o much as a <hi>mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if people muÅ¿t eate, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as MiniÅ¿ters muÅ¿t give them to eate, Å¿o
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:150587:159"/> Å¿o they muÅ¿t give them Å¿uch as they may eate. A man may give bread and meate to be eaten, and yet it may be Å¿uch Å¿tuffe as cannot be eaten, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>If a Å¿on Å¿hall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a Å¿tone?</hi> That were the way to choake him, and not to feed him: <hi>Or if he aske a fiÅ¿h, will he for a fiÅ¿h give him a Serpent?</hi> That were the way to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on him, and not to cheriÅ¿h him. Men cannot eate Å¿tones, mens teeth are not able to chew and grinde them, nor their Å¿tomackes able to digeÅ¿t them. A man may preach, and yet preach Å¿o as people can finde nothing in it that they may eate. Schoole points, and quiddities that tranÅ¿cends vulgar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities are Å¿tony food, not Å¿tones turned into bread, as Satan would have ChriÅ¿t have done, but rather bread turned into Å¿tones. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That Å¿hall feed you with underÅ¿tanding.</hi> Therefort that which muÅ¿t be eaten muÅ¿t be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood. Men dare not eate Serpents and Scorpions, who can blame them if they feare to be poyÅ¿oned. See how
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:150587:159"/> ChriÅ¿t was uÅ¿ed, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 69.21. <hi>They gave me alÅ¿o gall for my meat, and in my thirÅ¿t they gave me vineger to drinke.</hi> And therefore when it was tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.23. <hi>They gave it him, but he received it not.</hi> And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if people receive not, and eate not meate mingled with gall, when they are fed with bitter invectives. <hi>Hold faÅ¿t the forme of Å¿ound, or wholÅ¿ome words.</hi> Now many doe Å¿et before people Å¿uch rotten and unwholÅ¿ome food, Å¿uch traÅ¿h and unÅ¿avoury food, and Å¿uch poyÅ¿onous Å¿tuffe, that it is with people as it was with them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.40. <hi>As they were eating of the pottage, they cryed out, O man of God, Death is in the pot. And they could not eate thereof.</hi> So it is here, there is coloquintida and wilde goards in the pot, many times a whole lap full, and when there is death in the pot, what wonder that people cannot eate thereof.</p>
                  <p>Or if men preach truth, yet it is done with Å¿uch unbeÅ¿eeming levity and vanity, after Å¿uch a Å¿tage faÅ¿hion, that there is no nouriÅ¿hing Å¿ubÅ¿tance in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:150587:160"/> it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Å¿hall feed you with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> with that which Å¿hall edifie and build you up in knowledge, not with huskes as the prodigall was fed.</p>
                  <p>Or if truth propounded, yet it is meate Å¿o negligently dreÅ¿t, Å¿o Å¿luttiÅ¿hly cooked, that the very Å¿ight of it takes away mens Å¿tomackes, that as <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> in another caÅ¿e <hi>made the people abhoorre and loath the Lords offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;</hi> Å¿o many Å¿o marre the meate in the dreÅ¿Å¿ing, that men can have no Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke to eate it. So that it may bee Å¿aid of many Sermons, as the Prophet Å¿peakes of thoÅ¿e Figges, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.2. <hi>And the other basket had very naughty Figges which could not be eaten they were Å¿o bad.</hi> And as your proverbe is, <hi>God Å¿ends meat, and the Divell Å¿ends Cookes.</hi> So it may be more truely Å¿aid in this caÅ¿e, God Å¿ends meate and gives his Word, but there be many Cookes not of his Å¿ending, that make Å¿uch rotten meate, Å¿uch Å¿lovenly meate, Å¿uch traÅ¿hy meat, Å¿uch bitter meat, Å¿uch unÅ¿avoury loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome meat, that it cannot be eaten for badneÅ¿Å¿e. Therefore Å¿ince people muÅ¿t

Such a diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition takes off the Å¿tomack from whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome food. <hi>The IÅ¿raelites had Angels food, the bread of Heaven,</hi> and yet at laÅ¿t this food would not down with them, nay <hi>they loathed their Manna:</hi> And a man will not eate what hee loathes. But what was the cauÅ¿e that they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to eate manna? See <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>They fell a luÅ¿ting (or they luÅ¿ted a luÅ¿t) and Å¿aid, who Å¿hall give us fleÅ¿h to eate?</hi> and <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 5. <hi>fiÅ¿h to eate, and they long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the garlicke and onyons of Egypt;</hi> and therefore now this Manna will not downe with them. So men, when
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:150587:162"/> once they begin to luÅ¿t a luÅ¿t after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in doctrine, the wholÅ¿ome Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury truth of God they begin to loath, they are weary of it, quite cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, then no wonder it is not eaten. When once mens lippes hang after Egyptian food, popiÅ¿h and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine, then truth will not downe by any meanes, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 44.20. <hi>He feedeth on aÅ¿hes.</hi> That is but Å¿trange food, a mad dyet for a man to live and feed on aÅ¿hes. But what makes him feed Å¿o fondly? <hi>A deceived heart hath turned him aÅ¿ide.</hi> So with many. deceived heart hath turned them aÅ¿ide, and then they fall to eating of aÅ¿hes, and therefore, like thoÅ¿e that have the greene Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, their mindes hang af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aÅ¿hes, and Å¿uch traÅ¿h, and Å¿o no mind to the wholÅ¿ome food of Å¿ound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. See the caÅ¿e cleare, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>They will not endure it,</hi> therefore not eate it, not indure it, as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the meate he loathes. But why not indure it? <hi>They have itching eares,</hi> that itch after novelties, and therefore <hi>Å¿hall turn away their eares, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, or if yee will from deadneÅ¿Å¿e. Sicke men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ake their meate, and refuÅ¿e their meat. Men are Å¿piritually Å¿icke, and have Å¿ome diÅ¿eaÅ¿es upon them that make them eate nothing at all, or elÅ¿e they doe but piddle, and trifle, as good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit, as never the better. Nay, men are dead, void of the life of God, and that's a maine reaÅ¿on that they eat not. Dead men cannot eate.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Å¿ince it is a duty that muÅ¿t be done, therefore let people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themÅ¿elves whether they doe it or not, whether the Word be eaten by them or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> How may one know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he eates the Word or not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> By theÅ¿e things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> By Å¿pirituall cheerefulneÅ¿Å¿e, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> livelineÅ¿Å¿e and quickning. When a man hath eaten, it makes him cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and lively, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. <hi>He fills our heart with food and gladneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> A man when hee hath faÅ¿ted, and long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne his meate, his Å¿pirits waÅ¿te and decay; but when hee eates, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:150587:163"/> his Å¿pirits, and renewes them, and Å¿o makes a man come to himÅ¿elfe, and makes him freÅ¿h and lively. See <hi>Jonathans</hi> caÅ¿e, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.27, 29, 30. Hee was faint and his Å¿pirits Å¿pent Å¿o, that his eyes began to grow dimme through faintneÅ¿Å¿e and want of Å¿pirit, <hi>and he doth but eate a little honey,</hi> and his Å¿pirits are refreÅ¿ht, and repaired, that <hi>his eyes were enlightned.</hi> And if but a <hi>taÅ¿te</hi> of the honey did Å¿o much, <hi>How much more Å¿ayes Jonathan, if the people had eaten freely,</hi> had they beene chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and repaired. Wee finde a man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.12. <hi>that had eaten nothing in three dayes and three nights,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of which his Å¿pirits were quite gone, and hee was even a dead man: But Å¿ee <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>And when he had eaten, his Å¿pirit came againe unto him.</hi> It was in a manner gone from him before, but now hee had eaten hee was Å¿o refreÅ¿ht and cheered, that hee was alive againe, his Å¿pirit came againe.</p>
                  <p>So it is in this eating, it fills the Å¿oule with cheerefulneÅ¿Å¿e and livelineÅ¿Å¿e. A man that eates the Word indeed findes
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:150587:164"/> his heart finely cheered, filled with Å¿pirits, <hi>Thy words were found by me, and I did eate them.</hi> How did that appeare? <hi>And it was unto me the joy and rejoycing of mine heart:</hi> Oh how mine heart was cheered within mee, oh how my Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was refreÅ¿ht! <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. <hi>My Å¿onne, if thou finde honey,</hi> as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did, <hi>eate it for it is good.</hi> So eate this honey for it is good. Why what good will follow upon it? If thou be faint, lumpiÅ¿h, Å¿pirits downe, dim Å¿ighted, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten thine eyes, it will Å¿o cheere thy Å¿pirits, that it will recover thy deadneÅ¿Å¿e, and dimneÅ¿Å¿e, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and enliven thee. When that man had eaten, his Å¿pirit came againe: If before thou wert dead, and heavy, and lumpiÅ¿h unto good duties, yet if thou doe eate the Word, one good meale of it will recover thee out of that deadneÅ¿Å¿e, and make thee lively and cheerefull in duties of worÅ¿hip and obedience. By this try thy Å¿elfe. If thus it be with thee, thou haÅ¿t eaten the Word, but the <hi>little</hi> quickning, refreÅ¿hing, the little enÅ¿piriting of men
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:150587:164"/> after the Word heard, argues how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle men doe eate it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> by Å¿pirituall Å¿atisfaction. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2,"/> A man that is hungry his Å¿tomack is Å¿til craving, and he deÅ¿iring Å¿omething that he wants, and let him have this, or that, yet hee is not Å¿atisfied, unleÅ¿Å¿e he may eate. Mirth, muÅ¿ick, company, pleaÅ¿ure, let an hungry man have, yet there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes no Å¿atisfaction, Å¿till his Å¿tomacke craves. But let a man but eate, then there is a Å¿atisfaction, and that craving is over. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.25. <hi>They did eate and they were filled.</hi> And Å¿o in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the loaves, it is Å¿aid, <hi>they did all eate and were filled,</hi> their hunger was allayed and Å¿atisfied. So it is here: The heart of man is full of cravings, and hungrings after profits, pleaÅ¿ures, vanities, luÅ¿ts, and though a man eate of theÅ¿e never Å¿o much, theÅ¿e Å¿atisfie not the hungry cravings of the heart, nay the more they are fed upon, Å¿till the heart craves them more: But now when a man eates the Word, all theÅ¿e cravings of the heart ceaÅ¿e, and are Å¿atisfied. A man upon eating the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:150587:165"/> Word findes Å¿uch Å¿atisfaction in it, and his heart Å¿o fitted, that it is at reÅ¿t from thoÅ¿e troubleÅ¿ome and inordinate cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, theÅ¿e unnaturall dogged appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are quenched. The Å¿oule that eates the Word findes it Å¿elfe Å¿o abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Å¿atisfied, that it lingers not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the profits and pleaÅ¿ures of the world. Hee that eates this Manna lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not after the fleÅ¿h-pots, the ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and garlicke of Egypt. <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Wherefore doe yee Å¿pend mony for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which Å¿atisfieth not? hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto me, and eate yee that which is good, and let your Å¿oule delight it Å¿elfe in fatneÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> though theÅ¿e things then Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie not, yet the Word it Å¿atisfies, and fills, and feeds, and fattens.</p>
                  <p>By this may men try themÅ¿elves, if they have Å¿o received the Word, as that their hearts are weaned from their carnall and worldly luÅ¿ts, thoÅ¿e inÅ¿atiable cravings are at an end, Å¿uch Å¿atisfaction is a Å¿igne that a man hath eaten: But the contrary Å¿hewes how few have eaten. Many would Å¿eeme
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:150587:165"/> to eate, and profeÅ¿Å¿e they have eaten, but yet their hunger after the world, their profits and pleaÅ¿ures, are as keene and as eager as ever. Their hearts doe reÅ¿tleÅ¿ly crave theÅ¿e things. Thine heart is not <hi>filled,</hi> therefore thou haÅ¿t not <hi>eaten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by Å¿pirituall Å¿trength, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fatneÅ¿Å¿e, good liking, good complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Å¿o it is in bodily eating, keep men from eating and their Å¿trength decayes, they grow feeble, their complexion decayes, and they looke with an ill complexion, pale, wan, and ill colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As wee Å¿ee in a Å¿iege, when men have beene coopt up, and have not had meate to eate, they have come out like Å¿o many dead carkaiÅ¿es out of their graves, Å¿o weake, Å¿o poore, Å¿uch ghoÅ¿tly lookes, as it is enough to Å¿care a man with the Å¿ight of them. But now eating mends all this, that breeds good blood, health, Å¿trength, fatneÅ¿Å¿e, and a good habitude of body. Upon eating followes Å¿trength, Å¿trength to walke, and to worke, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. <hi>And he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roÅ¿e and did eate and drinke, and went in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:150587:166"/> the Å¿trength of that meate forty dayes and forty nights, unto Horeb the mount of God.</hi> Upon eating followes fatneÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.25. <hi>They did eate, and they were fat.</hi> Upon eating followes goodneÅ¿Å¿e of complexion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.13. upon the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this pulÅ¿e, <hi>their countenances were faire and fat.</hi> And thus is it upon eating the Word, men have Å¿trength in their Å¿oules to walke in the wayes of God, men grow fat, grow up as calves of the Å¿tall, <hi>full of good, Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>they are fat, and flouriÅ¿hing, PÅ¿al.</hi> 92.14. They have faire and good complexi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, their wiÅ¿dome and other graces cauÅ¿e their faces to Å¿hine, their lives and carriages are faire and lovely. And by this may men know whether they have eaten the Word or not. If it be thus with them, that they have Å¿trength againÅ¿t their luÅ¿ts, if they have Å¿trength to walke in obedience, &amp;c. a Å¿igne they have eaten the Word. But this Å¿hewes that few have eaten and doe eate the Word.</p>
                  <p>Many Å¿ay they doe, but how is it they be Å¿o weake and Å¿o feeble, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:150587:166"/> they cannot walke and worke? How is it that they be Å¿o leane, that there is Å¿uch an emptineÅ¿Å¿e of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Why art thou, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Å¿onne leane, or thin from day to day?</hi> Å¿o how is it that thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kings dyet, the bread of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, art thus thin and leane? How is it that thy life, thy complexion mends not, but thy complexion and converÅ¿ation is Å¿o ill? It fares with many as in that caÅ¿e, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.18.21. When the Å¿even leane kine and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured had eaten up the fat, <hi>It could not be knowne that they had eaten them, they were Å¿till as hadgeld hildings and carrion-like Å¿croyles as before.</hi> So here, men Å¿ay they have eaten, but looke on their lives, and it cannot be knowne, as arrant Å¿croyles as ever, as very Å¿wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, drunkards, as ever, as proud, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, looÅ¿e as ever. A cleare Å¿igne that Å¿uch doe not eate the Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they that eate the word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will ever doe as <hi>Eve</hi> did when Å¿hee did eate the forbidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who gave alÅ¿o to her husband, and hee
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:150587:167"/> did eate;</hi> Å¿o ever here. There is no Å¿uch good fellowÅ¿hip as in this eating, where there is no man that would eate alone, As <hi>Job</hi> 31.17. where that holy man profeÅ¿Å¿eth, <hi>That hee had not eaten his morÅ¿ell himÅ¿elfe alone, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e had not eaten thereof:</hi> Å¿o here, none that eateth the Word of God eateth his morÅ¿ell himÅ¿elfe alone, and giveth not the fatherleÅ¿Å¿e and needy Å¿oule to eate thereof: But as in <hi>SamÅ¿ons</hi> Riddle <hi>Out of the eater came meate:</hi> Å¿o here out of the eater of the Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth meate to feed others, judge by this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the Word muÅ¿t be eaten, then it teacheth us to be frequent in hearing, and diligent in taking all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. Some men can content themÅ¿elves, if need be, with one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in a yeere, and it is enough a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience if well followed: One meale in a yeere were Å¿hort commons. A man deÅ¿ires to eate every day twice, Å¿ome thrice a day. There is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of eating frequently: Å¿o here, take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of hearing and reading the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:150587:167"/> Word, Å¿ome morÅ¿ell every day, and miÅ¿Å¿e not publike meales. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.5. &amp; 7. where <hi>the Prophet Eliah was by the Angel bidden to eate,</hi> and hee did Å¿o; yea though hee had eaten but juÅ¿t before, yet hee goes to it againe the Å¿econd time, <hi>being bidden a Å¿econd time.</hi> If thou have eaten in the morning, yet, if God call to it a Å¿econd time, eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the afternoone. If thou have eaten on the Sabboth, yet if God give opportunity and liberty, eate alÅ¿o on the weeke day. The Word is to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and eating muÅ¿t bee frequent and often.</p>

                  <p>In this Preface hee gives Å¿uch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ells, as being liÅ¿tned to, may prove Å¿trong preÅ¿ervatives againÅ¿t the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of that peÅ¿tilence. One is that, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 22. ReÅ¿pect and obedience to parents holy counÅ¿els. ThoÅ¿e heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to would be Å¿peciall meanes to Å¿ave men out of thoÅ¿e Å¿nares. Another in this verÅ¿e, which is an exhortation to the Å¿tudy and acquiÅ¿ition of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, grace, and Religion, with which the heart being effectually Å¿eaÅ¿oned, it would in Å¿peciall manner Å¿ave a man
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:150587:170"/> from that Å¿inne. And Å¿o it Å¿uites with that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 16, 17. <hi>When wiÅ¿edome entreth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleaÅ¿ant unto thy Å¿oule; DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion Å¿hall preÅ¿erve thee, underÅ¿tanding Å¿hall keepe thee: To deliver thee from the way of the evill man, from the man that Å¿peaketh froward things. To deliver thee from the Å¿trange woman, even from the Å¿tranger which flattereth with her words: Which forÅ¿aketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</hi> WiÅ¿dome and truth, godlineÅ¿Å¿e and grace will preÅ¿erve both from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill man, and the evill woman. Thus this verÅ¿e Å¿tands in coherence with the others.</p>
                  <p>Take the words now in themÅ¿elves conÅ¿idered, and they are an exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Å¿tirre up men to beÅ¿tirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves with all paines and diligence, to get knowledge, godlineÅ¿Å¿e, grace, &amp;c. for that is comprehended under <hi>truth, wiÅ¿dome, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had Å¿aid, Let it be your maine care and labour, to get the knowledge of the truth, to get grace and Religion into your hearts.

So here hee would have them Å¿o affected to the truth, that they Å¿hould trade for it, be at paines and coÅ¿t for the compaÅ¿Å¿ing and getting of it.

                  <p>So then here be two things in theÅ¿e words:
<list>
                        <item>1. A precept, <hi>Buy the truth.</hi>
                        </item>

                  <p>FirÅ¿t to to begin with the precept, <hi>Buy the truth, alÅ¿o wiÅ¿dome, inÅ¿truction, and underÅ¿tanding,</hi> or as Å¿ome tranÅ¿late, <hi>Buy the truth, of wiÅ¿dome, &amp;c.</hi> Buy the truth.

That truth which is of wiÅ¿dome, of inÅ¿truction, of underÅ¿tanding, the truth that is in piety, godlineÅ¿Å¿e, religion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godlineÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That truth, wiÅ¿dome, underÅ¿tanding,</hi>

                     <hi>godlineÅ¿Å¿e, grace and religion are not to be had for nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the duty of every one to uÅ¿e all meanes and diligence to get the truth, to be willing to be at the coÅ¿t of all paines and diligence for the buying and compaÅ¿Å¿ing the truth, wiÅ¿dome, godlineÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;c. TheÅ¿e are commodities which will not be had without coÅ¿t. They are commodities that will not fall into mens mouthes, but they muÅ¿t be bought. Hee Å¿ayes not, <hi>Take</hi> the truth, as if it might be had for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up, but <hi>buy</hi> the truth; there muÅ¿t be a price given for it, and men
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:150587:172"/> muÅ¿t be at coÅ¿t before they can have it.</p>
                  <p>See how <hi>Araunah</hi> Å¿peakes to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.22. <hi>Let my Lord the King take, and offer up what Å¿cemes good unto him, &amp;c.</hi> and Å¿ee <hi>Davids</hi> anÅ¿wer, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 24. <hi>Nay but I will Å¿urely buy it of thee at a price, neither will I offer of that which doth coÅ¿t me nothing:</hi> So here, many it may be would be content to have theÅ¿e things, if they might have them for Å¿tooping and taking up. Nay, but they muÅ¿t buy it at a price, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we Å¿hould think to have truth for <hi>that which doth coÅ¿t us nothing.</hi> It muÅ¿t coÅ¿t men a price, and a good round price too, <hi>Buy the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that we have elÅ¿ewhere, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Get wiÅ¿dome, get understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 7. <hi>With all thy gettings get underÅ¿tanding.</hi> It is the Å¿elfe-Å¿ame word that is uÅ¿ed here, and may be, as it is by Å¿ome tranÅ¿lated, <hi>Buy wiÅ¿dome, buy underÅ¿tanding,</hi> and with all thy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>buy underÅ¿tanding. Get it,</hi> Å¿ay Å¿ome; <hi>Buy it,</hi> Å¿ay others, it all comes to one, for it is to be gotten with buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:150587:172"/> The way to <hi>get</hi> it, is to <hi>buy</hi> it. It is not a commodity that goes a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; it muÅ¿t be bought before it can be got. It is the counÅ¿ell that ChriÅ¿t gives, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counÅ¿ell thee to buy of me Gold tryed in the fire.</hi> Could not ChriÅ¿t give it as a matter of Almes? No, hee will have it bought, or they Å¿hall goe without it. He doth not Å¿ay, I counÅ¿ell thee to <hi>take</hi> gold of mee, but to <hi>buy</hi> gold of mee, hee will have men draw, and draw deep too before they have it.</p>
                  <p>It is that is called for, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come ye, buy and eate, buy Wine and milk.</hi> It is not enough to come and looke and gaze upon this commodity, to praiÅ¿e and commend it, no not enough to bid for it, and offer for it, but wee muÅ¿t Å¿trike through the bargaine, and buy it. A man may bid and not buy, but wee muÅ¿t bid and buy both. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. <hi>The man that findes the treaÅ¿ure in the field, goes and buyes the field.</hi> Hee doth not wiÅ¿h hee had the field, he doth not bid money for the field, and then leave it, but hee goes
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:150587:173"/> thorow with the bargaine, hee buyes, and purchaÅ¿es the field. And <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 45, 46. <hi>The Merchant when bee finds a pearle of great price, hee buyes it.</hi> ChriÅ¿tians Å¿hould be Merchants, men that drive a trade. When commodities are Å¿et forth in Marts and Fayres, yee have many country people will come and gaze upon them, and will cheapen, and be asking the prices, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meane to buy them: They will cheapen pearles and jewels, &amp;c. onely to know their worth and prices; but now when a Merchant comes, he chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and buyes: So ChriÅ¿tians driving a trade for Heaven, and being Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they muÅ¿t buy thoÅ¿e pearles, buy thoÅ¿e commodities that are Å¿et to Å¿ale.</p>
                  <p>There be foure things that may make a man willing to buy the truth. The Å¿ame things that make men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay out their money for other commodities.</p>

                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> it is a neceÅ¿Å¿ary and uÅ¿efull commodity. Indeed things that a man hath no need of, no uÅ¿e of, hee hath
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:150587:173"/> no minde to buy, or to lay out his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for them. It is no providence nor good husbandry, to buy Å¿uch things as hee hath no need or uÅ¿e of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.29. <hi>Buy thoÅ¿e things that we have need of.</hi> If a man want bread, want clothing for him and his, hee is willing to lay out his money, and to buy them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e theÅ¿e things hee hath need of. NeceÅ¿Å¿ity forces him to buy theÅ¿e: So here, the truth is a neceÅ¿Å¿ary commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, an uÅ¿efull commodity. It was when ChriÅ¿t was diÅ¿perÅ¿ing, and many hearing the Word of truth, that ChriÅ¿t Å¿pake that Å¿peech, <hi>One thing is needfull:</hi> As if he had Å¿aid, Thou thinkeÅ¿t much at <hi>Mary,</hi> that Å¿hee is at this market, that Å¿he is buying this commodity, but blame her not, it is a needfull commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and therefore Å¿hee doth well to buy it. It is as neceÅ¿Å¿ary as Heaven and Å¿alvation it Å¿elfe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who will have all men to be Å¿aved.</hi> I, that men like well, but marke what followes, <hi>and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Marke then, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Å¿alvation,</hi> till men come to the

                     <hi>knowledge of the truth.</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> muÅ¿t be had before <hi>Heaven</hi> can bee had. Truth therefore being Å¿o needfull a commodity, and Å¿o uÅ¿efull, there is great reaÅ¿on we Å¿hould be forward to buy it, and to be at coÅ¿t for it. There is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of buying it, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at coÅ¿t for it, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counÅ¿ell thee to buy of me white rayment that thou mayÅ¿t be cloathed, and that the Å¿hame of thy nakedneÅ¿Å¿e doe not appeare.</hi> There is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of clothing, a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of covering ones nakedneÅ¿Å¿e, therefore a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of buying knowledge, grace, religion, godlineÅ¿Å¿e, being things of Å¿uch neceÅ¿Å¿ary uÅ¿e, men muÅ¿t be at coÅ¿t and charges for them, men ought to buy them.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a profitable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a gainefull commodity, there is much to be gotten, and gained by the buying of it. Hee that trades in this commodity Å¿hall never be a loÅ¿er by it, nay hee Å¿hall be a great Å¿aver and gainer by it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>GodlineÅ¿Å¿e is great gaine.</hi> If it were but gaine it were Å¿omewhat, and it were enough to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:150587:174"/> croÅ¿Å¿e the conceit of the world, that counts godlineÅ¿Å¿e loÅ¿Å¿e and hindrance, but that is not all, it is <hi>great gaine,</hi> it brings in great returnes, rich returnes, it brings in Å¿uch advantage as makes a man.</p>
                  <p>Thirty and forty in the hundred are counted great gaines in trading, but this buying and trading brings in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by farre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.27, 29. <hi>Then anÅ¿wered Peter and Å¿aid to him, Behold, we have forÅ¿aken all, and followed thee: what Å¿hall wee have? And whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall forÅ¿ake houÅ¿es, or brethren, or Å¿iÅ¿ters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my Names Å¿ake, hee Å¿hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred fold more, and Å¿hall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite everlaÅ¿ting life.</hi> As if hee had Å¿aid, Lord we have beene at great coÅ¿t, and great charges to buy the truth, what Å¿hall wee have? what gaine will our adventure bring us in? what Å¿hall wee get by the buying of this commodity? ChriÅ¿t anÅ¿wers, <hi>Every one that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aken, &amp;c. Å¿hall receive an hundred fold.</hi> Where marke, that the gaine is not one for an hundred, but an hundred for
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:150587:175"/> one, as if a man Å¿hould lay out a pound, and gaine an hundred pound by laying out one. The gaine of buying this commodity, is like the gaine that <hi>IÅ¿aac</hi> had by Å¿owing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.12. Who <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Å¿ame yeere an hundred fold.</hi> And marke againe, that it is not in this trading and buying, as it is in buying and trading in other commodities. We Å¿ee in other trading in the World and buying, that Å¿ome men grow very rich, gaine great eÅ¿tates, but yet many get little, many loÅ¿e and are undone by trading. But now it is not Å¿o here: And <hi>every one,</hi> Å¿ayes ChriÅ¿t, <hi>that hath forÅ¿aken, &amp;c. Å¿hall receive an hundred fold.</hi> This commodity bought makes all gainers, gainers an hundred fold in in this life. Every Merchant of this Company is a gaining Merchant.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold profit or gaine to be had by buying the Truth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Life and happineÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Pro.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that here is that Å¿hould make us willing to buy the truth, and be at coÅ¿t for it, and to come off roundly for it too, in that it is Å¿o profitable and gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a commodity. If a man Å¿ees a commodity in the Market that will
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:150587:176"/> yeeld profit, that will bring him in gaine, hee need not be intreated to buy it, hee will be Å¿ure to lay hold on it, to faÅ¿ten upon it, hee will have it though hee borrow the money to buy it. Gainefull commodities uÅ¿e not to hang in hand, but they are preÅ¿ently Å¿natcht up, there is catching at Å¿uch commodities to buy them. The truth therefore being a commodity in which there is gaine and advantage to be had, what ever it coÅ¿t, what ever be the price, buy it, loÅ¿e not the buying of a gainefull commodity. <hi>What Å¿hall it profit a man to gaine the whole world, and loÅ¿e his owne Å¿oule?</hi> Hee that makes Å¿uch a bargaine, makes but a loÅ¿ing bargaine: And Å¿o, what Å¿hall it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage a man to loÅ¿e, to give the whole world, and to gaine his owne Å¿oule? He that makes Å¿uch a bargaine, makes a Å¿aving, a gaining bargaine. Hee that buyes the truth, though hee give the whole world for it, makes a gaining bargaine, becauÅ¿e he gaines his Å¿oule, and Heaven by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is a pretious commodity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:150587:177"/> of great worth and excellency, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed is the man that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wiÅ¿dome, and the man that getteth underÅ¿tanding. For the merchandiÅ¿e there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is better then the merchandiÅ¿e of Å¿ilver, and the gaine thereof is better then gold. It is more precious then pearles: and all things that thou canÅ¿t deÅ¿ire, are not to be compared unto her.</hi> See <hi>Job.</hi> 28.12. 16, 19. <hi>But where is wiÅ¿dome found? and where is the place of underÅ¿tanding? It Å¿hall not be valued with the wedge of gold of Ophir, nor with the pretious Onix, nor the Saphir. The Topaz of Ethiopia Å¿hall not be equall unto it, neither Å¿hall it be valued with the wedge of pure gold. Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>The Merchant Å¿eekes pearles, and he findes one pearle of great price,</hi> of great value and worth. It is no vile and paltry commodity, but a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity very pretious: And therefore worth the buying. Things that bee vile, who will buy them? refuÅ¿e Å¿tuffe none will lay out money about them. But when things are pretious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, their excellency tempts men to buy. What made the Merchant in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:150587:177"/> the Parable to Å¿ell all that he had, and to buy the pearle? It was a great price to give all that hee had, it Å¿eemes to coÅ¿t exceeding deere. To have given halfe that he had one would thinke had been enough, but he gives all that he hath to buy it. And what was the reaÅ¿on? It was a pearle, and it was a pearle of great price: Å¿o Truth being a pearle, and a pearle of great price, loÅ¿e not the buying of Å¿o pretious a commodity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is a commodity we can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> never be over-reacht in, we cannot be cheated and coÅ¿end in. A man is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht, and coÅ¿end in buying when hee gives more for a commodity than it is worth, when the commodity bought, and the price given have no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are not of equall value, the buyer hath not a pennyworth for his penny. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.15. <hi>The land is worth foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Å¿hekels of Å¿ilver.</hi> So long as the land was <hi>worth</hi> it, <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have an hard bargaine, could not bee over-reacht in it, could have no cauÅ¿e to repent him, though hee gave foure
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:150587:178"/> hundred Å¿hekels of Å¿ilver. <hi>The land was worth it:</hi> Å¿o here, in buying the Truth a man Å¿hall bee Å¿ure not to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht, he Å¿hal be Å¿ure not to be pincht with an hard bargaine, becauÅ¿e let it coÅ¿t what it will, let the price be never Å¿o high, let a man give what he will, yet the truth is <hi>worth</hi> it, and a man Å¿hall be Å¿ure to have a pennyworth for his penny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.15. <hi>All the things thou canÅ¿t deÅ¿ire are not to be compared to her. Prov.</hi> 8.11. <hi>For WiÅ¿edome is better than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Å¿tones, and all pleaÅ¿ures are not to be compared unto her.</hi> The higheÅ¿t price that can be Å¿et is diÅ¿proportionable to the worth of it, is beneath the value of the commodity. <hi>Iob</hi> 28.17. Though it be a neceÅ¿Å¿ary commodity, a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, gainefull commodity, a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commodity, yet at any price it is Å¿et at, it is a cheape commodity, and the price is low. A man cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reacht when the commodity is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, profitable, precious, and yet the price low. How can a man be over-reacht where the commodity is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:150587:178"/> profitable, and cheape both? Now this commodity as it is well worth all our paines, endevours, coÅ¿ts; Å¿o all we can doe and give, it is but cheape, it is but an eaÅ¿ie low price. <hi>IÅ¿.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come buy wine and milke without money, and without price,</hi> that is, without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious price, as he that gives the money, and the price that a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is worth in point of commutative JuÅ¿tice deÅ¿erves to have the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and it is InjuÅ¿tice to hold it from him. Thus wee muÅ¿t buy without price, becauÅ¿e no man can give a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious price to God for Grace and Heaven. Buy without price, that is, without meritorious price; or elÅ¿e thus to our preÅ¿ent purpoÅ¿e. It is true that Truth muÅ¿t bee bought with a price, and with a great price, but yet the greateÅ¿t price that is, is Å¿o beneath the commodity, that it is no price. As we Å¿ay of a cheape commodity that is bought for little, that it is no price. Ten thouÅ¿and pound is a great Å¿umme of money, an huge Å¿umme, but for a man to buy ten thouÅ¿and pound a yeer
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:150587:179"/> for the price of ten thouÅ¿and pound, it is but one yeares purchaÅ¿e, it is no price, ten thouÅ¿and pound is no mony, no price to ten thouÅ¿and pound a yeere. It is a great deale of paines, and coÅ¿t that a man muÅ¿t bee at to get the Truth, to get ChriÅ¿t, and Grace, but the worth of the commodity conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and the tranÅ¿cendency of the value of it above coÅ¿t and paines, all our coÅ¿t and paines is no money, is no price. And how can a man bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht, or have an hard bargaine, when he hath a good bargaine for no price. Here is that then which may draw us on to Å¿trike thorow this bargaine, and may encourage us to trade, and buy, we Å¿hall be Å¿ure to have a pennyworth for our penny, we Å¿hall not bee pincht with a deere penny-worth. Many a man hath a great minde to Å¿uch an houÅ¿e, and land, he would faine buy it, he beates the price, and bids faire for it, but yet as good a minde as hee hath to it, he buyes it not, he feares it is to deere, he feares he Å¿hall repent him of his bargaine, and wiÅ¿h his money in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:150587:179"/> his purÅ¿e againe, and therefore falls off. But now here is no Å¿uch feare, what ever the Truth coÅ¿t thee, Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e it coÅ¿t thee much paines, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Å¿uppoÅ¿e it proves matter of great charge to thee, Å¿uppoÅ¿e it coÅ¿t thee thy credit and reÅ¿pect in the world, thy liberty, thine eÅ¿tate, thy bloud, thy life, yet thou buyeÅ¿t it not too deere; it is well worth all thou canÅ¿t give for it. A man may buy houÅ¿e and lands, good houÅ¿e and lands too deere, a man may buy Gold too deere, as the Proverb is, but yet hee cannot buy Truth, nor Grace, nor ChriÅ¿t, nor Heaven too deare. <hi>The Land is worth foure hundred Å¿hekles,</hi> and Heaven, and ChriÅ¿t, Truth, and Grace is worth all that ever. God Å¿hall aske for it.</p>
                  <p>A man may buy a good purchaÅ¿e of land, and yet have no cauÅ¿e to rejoyce in it, may wiÅ¿h hee had never medled with it, but had kept his money in his purÅ¿e. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.12. <hi>The time is come, the day draweth neere, let not the buyer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> Such times may come, as a man
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:150587:180"/> may have but little joy in buying a a purchaÅ¿e. But a man that buyes the Truth Å¿hall never repent him of his purchaÅ¿e, but let Å¿uch a buyer rejoyce. Come what times will come, yet he may rejoyce, yea the worÅ¿e the times may be, the more cauÅ¿e may he have to rejoyce in his purchaÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>Thus being convinced that this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be done, that Truth is to bee bought, come wee now to Å¿hew how this duty is to be done, and wherein this buying Å¿tands.</p>
                  <p>This buying then Å¿tands in diverÅ¿e things.</p>
                  <p>FirÅ¿t, In giving a price, and paying a price for it. In trading in the world, when a man gives the price for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, he buyes it, and a man cannot be Å¿aid to have bought a commodity till Å¿ome price be given for it, that is contracted for, <hi>ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. therefore in buying there is a price given. When <hi>Abraham</hi> bought the fields of <hi>Ephraim, he gave him the price of foure hundred Å¿hekels,</hi> and when hee gave that price then hee
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:150587:180"/> bought it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.6. <hi>ye Å¿hall buy meate of them that ye may eate, and ye Å¿hall buy water of them that ye may drinke.</hi> But how muÅ¿t they buy? yee Å¿hall buy meate of them <hi>for money,</hi> and ye Å¿hall buy water of them <hi>for money.</hi> That which a man hath without money, or Å¿ome valuable conÅ¿ideration; it is not bought, but is given freely, or taken unjuÅ¿tly. But when a man gives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for bread, gives money for water, then he buyes it. So in this caÅ¿e, hee that would buy Truth muÅ¿t give a price for it, it will not bee had for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that which a man hath for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is not bought. The price that men muÅ¿t give for Truth and Grace, is the uÅ¿e of all Å¿uch meanes by which Truth and Grace is to be gotten. So buy the Truth, that is, uÅ¿e all meanes by which it may bee had; God hath appointed certaine meanes in the uÅ¿e of which he will give Grace, and the knowledge of the Truth, and they that will have this commodity muÅ¿t give this price, muÅ¿t uÅ¿e Å¿uch meanes as God requires to be uÅ¿ed to this end.</p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:150587:181"/>
                  <p>This price that God Å¿ets is not a matter of money, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have bought that gift for money. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.18. <hi>He offred them money. But thy money periÅ¿h with thee,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Peter</hi> to him. <hi>We our Å¿elves are bought with a price.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. but yet 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>are not redeemed with Silver, and Gold, and corruptible things,</hi> Å¿o Truth, and Grace muÅ¿t bee bought, but yet it is not gold that will buy this Gold. But there is another price with which Truth muÅ¿t bee bought. The uÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that is the price; that look as by the giving of a price an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodity is bought, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Å¿o by the uÅ¿e of the meanes, Truth, and Grace is gotten, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And what then are thoÅ¿e meanes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> Prayer, Buy the truth, pray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1,"/> for the knowledge of the truth, pray for grace. As by money wee obtaine and buy the commodity wee neede, and have a minde to, Å¿o by prayer wee obtaine and buy the truth. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you lacke wiÅ¿dome.</hi> Shop-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:150587:181"/> as men paÅ¿Å¿e by their doores, aske them, What doe yee lacke? what is it that you want? So the ApoÅ¿tle here Å¿eemes to Å¿ay, what is it that ye lackc? what is it that ye want? Doe yee want grace? Do ye want knowledge and wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Well, what if we doe? How may wee come by it? <hi>Buy it,</hi> Å¿ayes the ApoÅ¿tle. I, but what is the price that muÅ¿t be given for it? If any man lacke wiÅ¿dome, Å¿tand in need of this commodity, <hi>let him aske of God.</hi> And it is the price that ChriÅ¿t Å¿ets upon grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Aske and ye Å¿hall have.</hi> The price that the Lord Å¿ets upon the knowledge of the truth. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. <hi>Call upon me, and I will anÅ¿wer thee, and Å¿hew thee great and hidden things which thou knoweÅ¿t not.</hi> God highly befriends us, hee Å¿ets the commodity at a low price. It is little worth that is not worth the asking. The way then to <hi>buy,</hi> is to <hi>beg; begging</hi> is <hi>buying,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> is <hi>paying.</hi> And therefore how often finde wee <hi>David</hi> in thoÅ¿e Å¿uites, <hi>Teach mee thy truth, teach me thy Statutes, &amp;c. David</hi> knew the commodity would not be bought without this price, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:150587:182"/> therefore hee Å¿tickes not at it, he gives the price, and Å¿eekes grace, and the knowledge of the truth by prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> hearing the Word, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> upon the MiniÅ¿tery thereof. As <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peakes of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>That JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was a MiniÅ¿ter of the circumciÅ¿ion for the truth of God:</hi> So it may in another Å¿enÅ¿e be Å¿aid of the MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel, That they are MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel for the truth of God, to make knowne the truth of God, to offer and tender it unto people. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Law of truth was in Levi's mouth.</hi> God Å¿ends them to Å¿et his truth to Å¿ale, they bring this commodity to Market: So that if wee would buy the truth, wee muÅ¿t attend upon them whoÅ¿e worke is to diÅ¿penÅ¿e the <hi>Word of truth,</hi> as the GoÅ¿pel is called, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1.13. And it is a part of the price that is to be given for it, to come to, &amp; attend upon their MiniÅ¿tery. See <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Law of truth was in his mouth,</hi> and <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 7. <hi>They Å¿hould Å¿eeke the Lawes (of truth) at his mouth.</hi> So then, they that would get
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:150587:182"/> the truth, muÅ¿t Å¿eeke it at the mouthes of Gods MiniÅ¿ters, and that is the way to get this commodity. This is part of the price, to come to the publike meanes, and to attend upon them. <hi>Come and buy, IÅ¿a.</hi> 55.1. Even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is a part of buying. If <hi>Jacobs</hi> Å¿onnes would buy Corne, they muÅ¿t not onely give money, but they muÅ¿t goe into Egypt, and their going into Egypt was one part of the price of it. They could not buy unleÅ¿Å¿e they went into Egypt, where it was to be bought. They that will buy a commodity, they muÅ¿t goe to the Market, and the Å¿hops where the commodity is to be bought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Goe to them that Å¿ell, and buy for your Å¿elves.</hi> So if men would buy the truth, they muÅ¿t goe to them that Å¿ell, and there buy. Now Gods MiniÅ¿ters are they that in a good Å¿enÅ¿e Å¿ell, and therefore to them, men muÅ¿t goe and buy. The Sabbaths are the Market dayes, the publike aÅ¿Å¿emblies are the Market places, and the Å¿hoppes where this commodity is to bee bought. And if men would buy, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:150587:183"/> they muÅ¿t goe, there they muÅ¿t waite. And this going to, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the ordinance of preaching is a part of the price that muÅ¿t be given to buy this pearle. <hi>Buy the truth then,</hi> that is, goe to the Word, and attend upon the preaching of the Word, goe to the Market and waite upon that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> reading the Scripture, and other Bookes, that may helpe us to the knowledge of the truth, and build us up in grace, mutuall conference, and meditation. This is a price that muÅ¿t be given for truth. It is not enough to uÅ¿e publike helpes, but wee muÅ¿t uÅ¿e private helpes alÅ¿o, wee muÅ¿t trade and traffique in private, as well as in publike. Thus in the uÅ¿e of the meanes that God hath appointed, wee muÅ¿t buy this pearle of Truth and Grace. God can infuÅ¿e grace and knowledge into us without our endeavours in the uÅ¿e of the meanes, but God will not doe it. His way is that the meanes Å¿hall be uÅ¿ed, and the uÅ¿e of the meanes is the price hee will have for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:150587:183"/> God gives grace, and the knowledge of the truth, as <hi>Boaz</hi> gave <hi>Ruth</hi> corne, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. Could not <hi>Boaz</hi> have given her at once as much corne as would have yeelded her <hi>an Ephah of Barley,</hi> and Å¿o have Å¿ent her home without any more adoe? Yes Å¿urely, hee could have done it, and it had beene no more charge for him to have done Å¿o: But yet hee would have her uÅ¿e her endeavours, <hi>to gather and to gleane it, and beat it out to, when Å¿he had gleaned it;</hi> and that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of hers Å¿hould bee the price Å¿hee Å¿hould pay for it. So God can give us knowledge by immediate revelation, and grace by immediate infuÅ¿ion, but yet hee will have us uÅ¿e the meanes in praying, hearing, reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and our labour and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veavour in the uÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e meanes Å¿hall be the price with which the truth muÅ¿t be bought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in giving and paying the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>full</hi> price for it. A man that will buy a commodity, muÅ¿t not onely give a a price for it, but hee muÅ¿t give the <hi>full</hi>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:150587:184"/> price that is asked for it. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was to buy the field of <hi>Ephron, I will give thee money for it,</hi> and <hi>Ephron</hi> tells him <hi>it is worth foure hundred Å¿heck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els:</hi> Now if <hi>Abraham</hi> will buy it, hee muÅ¿t give him his price: And Å¿o hee did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.16. <hi>Hee weighed unto him the Å¿ilver which hee had named,</hi> hee gave him the price which hee asked, and Å¿o bought the field. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him three hundred and fifty or three hundred and ninty Å¿heckels, hee had offered him a price, but not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrons</hi> price; hee had offered him Å¿il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but not the Å¿ilver hee named; hee had offered a price, but not the <hi>full</hi> price; and Å¿o the bargaine had not beene Å¿trucke thorow, the field had not beene bought. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.9. <hi>for as much money as it is worth,</hi> for <hi>full money,</hi> that is, as in the Hebrew, for the full price.</p>
                  <p>So it is here in the buying of the truth. Not onely muÅ¿t a price bee given, but a <hi>full</hi> price, Gods price that hee askes and Å¿ets. I may allude to that Å¿peech of ChriÅ¿ts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.12. <hi>If yee
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:150587:184"/> thinke good, give me my price, and if not forbeare.</hi> So the Lord in this caÅ¿e Å¿aies to us, If yee thinke good of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity that I offer to you, yee Å¿hall have it, but then you muÅ¿t not thinke to have it at your owne price, but you muÅ¿t give me my price, the price that I aske and Å¿et you. The Å¿eller Å¿ets one price, and the buyer offers another, but if the buyer offer too low a price, hee muÅ¿t riÅ¿e and come to the Å¿ellers price if hee will have his commodity. It is not enough then if wee will buy the truth to offer a price, and give a price, but wee muÅ¿t give Gods price, that is, the <hi>full</hi> price. Now Gods price, the full price is this, it Å¿tands in theÅ¿e two things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> in an induÅ¿trious, painefull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Å¿erious uÅ¿e of meanes. The <hi>uÅ¿e</hi> of meanes is a <hi>price,</hi> but the <hi>full</hi> price is the <hi>Å¿erious, induÅ¿trious</hi> uÅ¿e of the means, the uÅ¿ing of the meanes with all our might, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Then Å¿hall wee know if wee follow on to know the Lord.</hi> Many pray, heare, reade, &amp;c. and yet buy not the truth, nor get knowledge, nor
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:150587:185"/> grace, they indeed give a price, but it is not Gods price, not the full price, and therefore they have not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. The ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ayes of thoÅ¿e women, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. <hi>They were ever learning, and came not to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> They were cheapning and offering for it, but they never bought the truth, and all becauÅ¿e they came not to Gods price. There be Å¿ome that are ever praying, ever hearing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reading, and yet never come to the knowledge of the truth, never get true grace. Heere indeede is a price given, meanes are uÅ¿ed, but the full price is not given, meanes are not uÅ¿ed in good earneÅ¿t, Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly with all their might. It is not enough to pray for grace and the truth, but men muÅ¿t pray Å¿o as God would have them pray, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you lacke wiÅ¿dome, let him aske of God, which giveth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and it Å¿hall be given him.</hi> Well may one Å¿ay, if that be all, I will Å¿oone aske it, I will give that price willingly for it. I, but marke verÅ¿e 6. <hi>But let him aske in faith:</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:150587:185"/> That teaches thus much; That asking is not enough, unleÅ¿Å¿e men aske in that manner, for faith, and Å¿o for all other qualifications, as God requires. It muÅ¿t be faithfull, and fervent, earneÅ¿t prayer which is Gods price. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 5. <hi>If thou cryeÅ¿t and lifteÅ¿t up thy voyce, then, &amp;c.</hi> Hee Å¿ayes not, If thou <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t,</hi> that is to be done, that's part of the price, but if thou <hi>cryeÅ¿t.</hi> That's Gods price, to have fervent prayer, full of earneÅ¿tneÅ¿Å¿e and contention of Å¿pirit. Cold, formall, dead-hearted prayer is not Gods price, it is too low a price to fetch Å¿o rich a commodity. What muÅ¿t I give you, Å¿ay wee, when wee come to buy a commodity? So if wee would know here, <hi>My Å¿onne, give mee thine heart.</hi> In prayer for grace, give God thine heart. The tongue, the lippes, the voyce, is too low a price, God muÅ¿t bee prayed to Å¿eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly with the heart. Is that all? No, there is more yet; that Å¿ame, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.145. <hi>I cryed with my whole heart.</hi> That's the <hi>whole</hi> price, and <hi>full</hi> price in the point of prayer. Not Å¿ome of the

It is not enough to heare the Word, to get grace and the truth, but men muÅ¿t Å¿o heare as God requires, with Å¿uch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, with Å¿uch affection, with Å¿uch attention, with Å¿uch after endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as God commands. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.4. <hi>Sonne of man, behold with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and Å¿et thine heart upon all that I Å¿hall Å¿hew thee.</hi> Eyes and eares, and heart, muÅ¿t all be Å¿et on worke in the duty.

Therefore ChriÅ¿t bids us not barely, <hi>Reade the Scriptures,</hi> but <hi>to Å¿earch the Scriptures.</hi> A man muÅ¿t Å¿et his head and his heart on worke both in reading the Word. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>If thou Å¿eekeÅ¿t her as Å¿ilver,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:150587:187"/> and Å¿earcheÅ¿t for her as for treaÅ¿ures: Then Å¿halt thou underÅ¿tand the feare of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God.</hi> There is the full price. What paines doe men take to Å¿eeke and Å¿earch for treaÅ¿ures hid in the earth, for Å¿ilver in the Mynes: They dig thorow rockes, dig wonderfull deepe, follow every veyne, and Å¿earch every cranny where the Å¿ilver lyes; It coÅ¿ts a great deale of paines and labour, in Å¿earching, and digging for Å¿ilver; and Å¿o it muÅ¿t coÅ¿t a great deale of paines and induÅ¿try in the reading of the Word and Å¿earching of the Scriptures, that's Gods full price in this particular, if we will buy the truth. Slight and overly formall uÅ¿e of theÅ¿e meanes, are not price e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to buy the truth.</p>
                  <p>If a man aske ten pounds for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and one bid him but tenne pence, hee cannot buy that commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The buyer and Å¿eller will never meete at Å¿uch a diÅ¿tance. God hee askes diligence, painfulneÅ¿Å¿e, induÅ¿try, and labour of Å¿pirit in the uÅ¿e of meanes: Now if wee come with our
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:150587:188"/> dead and cold formalities, and make prayer but a lip-labour, hearing but an eare-labour, reading but an eye-labor, this is to offer God but ten pence, nay but ten tokens, when hee Å¿ets the price ten pounds: And they that come Å¿o Å¿hort of Gods price are never like to buy: God muÅ¿t have his full price, his whole price, and they are never like to buy that doe not give him his whole price, that offer him not halfe his price.</p>
                  <p>Here is that which keepes men off from buying, becauÅ¿e they are loth to goe to the full price, to bee at all that paines that muÅ¿t be taken in the uÅ¿e of the meanes. If prayer, hearing, reading, would doe it, they would not Å¿tick at that, but if Å¿o much paines and labour muÅ¿t bee taken in theÅ¿e, they thinke it too deare at Å¿uch prices &amp; rates, they will forbeare.

And thus fooles loÅ¿e a good bargaine becauÅ¿e they thinke it too deare upon thoÅ¿e tearmes, becauÅ¿e they will not give the full price. It is otherwiÅ¿e with an underÅ¿tanding man, that underÅ¿tands the worth of Truth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.14. <hi>The heart of him that hath underÅ¿tanding Å¿eeketh knowledge.</hi> Hee Å¿eekes or purÅ¿ues it. There bee many difficulties to be overcome, ere he can have it, it will coÅ¿t much paines, but he yet for all that Å¿eekes and purÅ¿ues after it, hee Å¿tickes not at that price. And againe, <hi>The heart of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Å¿eekes.</hi> Hee
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:150587:189"/> doth not onely <hi>Å¿peake</hi> of it, or <hi>heare others Å¿peake</hi> of it, but his <hi>heart,</hi> and his <hi>minde</hi> is upon it. And though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity be deare, yet if a man have a minde to it, he will have it though he pay the price. A man that hath an heart, and a minde Å¿eeking Truth, thogh the price of it be Å¿o much pains, labour and induÅ¿try in the uÅ¿e of means yet he will buy it at that price, he will give the full price of it. So that when he bids us <hi>Buy the truth,</hi> hee bids us not onely <hi>pray,</hi> but <hi>pray hard, pray earneÅ¿tly with thy whole heart,</hi> not onely <hi>heare,</hi> but <hi>heare with all diligence, attention, and intention of Å¿pirit:</hi> not onely <hi>reade,</hi> but <hi>reade Å¿earchingly, diligently.</hi> This is Gods price, this is to give the <hi>full</hi> price.

So <hi>the merchant that findes the pearle of great price, Matth.</hi> 13.46. <hi>hee goes and Å¿ells all that he had, and bought it.</hi> All that hee had was the full price of the pearle, and he came to the full price, parts with all that hee had, and Å¿o bought. Hee Å¿old not <hi>Å¿ome</hi> of that he had, that was but a <hi>pinne</hi> of the price, not <hi>halfe</hi> that hee had, that was but <hi>halfe</hi> the price, but hee comes to the <hi>full</hi> price, <hi>All that hee had, and bought it.</hi> A man that will have ChriÅ¿t, and buy his Truth, muÅ¿t part with all his luÅ¿ts, and give them all for this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Some man likes ChriÅ¿t and the Truth Å¿o well, that hee could bee content to part with this and that luÅ¿t, hee could as <hi>Herod, bee content to doe many things,</hi> and part with many things for the truth, but <hi>Herod</hi> hath one jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, his <hi>Herodias,</hi> hee is loath to buy
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:150587:190"/> truth Å¿o deare as to give her for it: It is too deare a price to buy truth at, to part with one Å¿o deare to him. I, but if <hi>Herod</hi> will have the truth, hee muÅ¿t come to Gods full price, not <hi>doing</hi> of <hi>many</hi> things, not the <hi>parting</hi> with <hi>Å¿ome</hi> luÅ¿ts and vanities, but the <hi>parting with all, Herodias</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> is Gods price. Bid wee, and offer wee what wee will, uÅ¿e meanes and endeavours, and goe on in them, yet if wee will not part with our luÅ¿ts, we Å¿hall never have the bargaine, nor buy the pearle. It is a pearle of great price, and therefore a great price, the Å¿elling and putting off all our luÅ¿ts, muÅ¿t be given for it, or elÅ¿e bid as oft and as faire as we will, it will not doe. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Ever learning, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> They bid faire for the truth. They were content to learne, and to bee at Å¿ome paines to get the knowledge of the truth, which is more then a great many will bid for it, nay they doe it not for a fit, but are ever learning, they Å¿eeme to follow it with Å¿ome cloÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and yet for all this never come to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:150587:190"/> the knowledge of the truth, ever bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but never come to buy the truth. Why? what's the matter they buy it not? BecauÅ¿e though they Å¿eeme to bid faire, yet they come not to the full price. They would Å¿ell Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to buy the pearle, but not Å¿ell all, not part with their Å¿infull luÅ¿ts, and therefore God denyed them the knowledge of the truth, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 16. <hi>They leade captive Å¿imple women laden with diverÅ¿e luÅ¿ts,</hi> which women are <hi>ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth. Prov.</hi> 14.6. <hi>A Å¿corner Å¿eeketh wiÅ¿dome, and findeth it not.</hi> Hee bids, and buyes not, hee will not give the full price, hee Å¿cornes at Å¿uch a deare price as to part with all his luÅ¿ts. There is no reaÅ¿on or equity that the buyer Å¿hould have a mans commodity at the price hee will Å¿et: The Å¿eller is to Å¿et the price, and if hee cannot have his price, hee wrongs no man to keepe his commodity to himÅ¿elfe, Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is richly worth the price hee Å¿ets. If therefore wee would buy the truth, Å¿ell away and part with all

It is true indeede that money will not buy grace: Indeed the Popes graces may be bought with money. There be Bookes in print of the taxes of the ApoÅ¿tolicall Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, in which bookes are Å¿old diÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations and abÅ¿olutions for all manner of villanies, and Å¿ome not to be named. And, Å¿ayes that Booke, theÅ¿e kinde of graces are not for the poore, becauÅ¿e they are deÅ¿titute of goods and means. But therefore theÅ¿e graces are for the rich, they may for money buy the Popes graces: But Gods graces are not to be had for money. So <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would faine have been trading.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:150587:192"/> And yet in one Å¿enÅ¿e wee muÅ¿t buy the Truth with our money, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good; That is, wee Å¿hould bee willing to be at coÅ¿ts and charges, and to Å¿pend money for the maintaining of thoÅ¿e meanes, and thoÅ¿e Ordinances in the uÅ¿e of which the truth is to bee gotten. Though we cannot buy grace for money, yet with our money wee may buy preaching, maintaine the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tery, we may buy Bibles, buy good Bookes, by all which wee may come to get the knowledge of the truth. And Å¿o in this Å¿enÅ¿e, wee muÅ¿t buy the truth with our money, and it is a part of Gods full price, and Å¿uch a price as muÅ¿t be given if men will buy the truth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. If need be part with <hi>any gettings to get the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though our money cannot buy grace, yet it can procure and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word and preaching of the GoÅ¿pel, by which the knowledge of the truth and grace is to be gotten. And therefore it is well noted by Å¿ome on that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. <hi>That the Merchant finding a rich
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:150587:193"/> treaÅ¿ure hid in the field, is Å¿aid to Å¿ell all and buy the field.</hi> He doth not buy the <hi>treaÅ¿ure,</hi> but the <hi>field,</hi> and Å¿o in buying the field hee buyes the treaÅ¿ure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

And this price God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, a part of his full price, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Let him that is taught make him that teaches him partaker of all his goods.</hi> God will not have the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word eleemoÅ¿ynary, to be matter of meere almes, but hee will have not onely mens <hi>paynes</hi> to heare the Word, but mens <hi>purÅ¿es</hi> to maintaine the Word, and his Ordinances, by which the truth is to be had. <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe would not have the doores of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Å¿hut for nought, nor fire kindled upon

Though our money cannot buy grace and knowledge of the truth, yet our money may buy Bibles, and good Bookes, by the reading whereof wee may come to get knowledge and grace So that when hee Å¿ayes, <hi>Buy the truth,</hi> hee Å¿ayes, <hi>Buy Bibles, buy good Bookes,</hi> and Å¿ticke not at the coÅ¿t and charge of them, but willingly bee at Å¿uch charge for the getting of the truth. It was a great price thoÅ¿e Bookes came to which they burned after they came to the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. <hi>They brought their Bookes together,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:150587:194"/> and burned them before all men, and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thouÅ¿and peeces of Å¿ilver.</hi> Surely they that in <hi>honour</hi> of the truth <hi>burned</hi> Bookes of Å¿o great price, would not have Å¿tucke in <hi>deÅ¿ire</hi> of the truth to have <hi>bought</hi> Bookes of great price. And thus our fore-fathers, godly chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, before <hi>Luthers</hi> time here in <hi>England,</hi> when there was Å¿ome glimpÅ¿e of the light of the GoÅ¿pel, they bought the truth, though at an high price. It is memorable which Mr. <hi>Foxe</hi> Å¿peakes of them. They did Å¿it up whole nights in reading, and hearing good Bookes read. That was one part of the price they gave. But they did not onely buy with their <hi>paines,</hi> but with their <hi>purÅ¿es,</hi> with their <hi>goods,</hi> being at great coÅ¿t and expences in buying Bookes in EngliÅ¿h. They gave Å¿ometimes five markes and more for a good Booke; they gave a loade of hay for a few chapters of Saint <hi>James,</hi> or Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in EngliÅ¿h. It was more money, five markes then, then ten pound is now. What a deale of coÅ¿t was it to buy
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:150587:194"/> Å¿uch bookes. I, but it was to buy the truth, and good men they thought truth deare at no price, nor the meanes of truth too high at any rate. It was Gods price then, and they Å¿hukt not at it. Thus is truth to be bought.</p>
                  <p>Buy the truth, lay out money and Å¿tick not at it, to maintaine preaching, to buy a Bible, &amp;c.

God Å¿ometimes raiÅ¿es the price, that truth cannot be bought nor had but at theÅ¿e high rates, That if a man will have it, it may coÅ¿t him his deereÅ¿t comforts, his very blood and life it Å¿elfe. Truth was very deare, at very high prices in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. It pleaÅ¿ed God that by the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing up Queene <hi>Elizabeth, a nurÅ¿ing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in IÅ¿rael,</hi> that the prices fell, and truth was had at eaÅ¿ier and lower rates. But yet when truth was at theÅ¿e deare prices in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, we Å¿ee the Å¿ervants of ChriÅ¿t did not Å¿ticke to give the price of their blood for it: And though it were as much as their lives were worth to be medling with the Truth, and the GoÅ¿pel, yet they were content to come to Gods full price, to the very higheÅ¿t price of all, to part with all the comforts of this life, and life it Å¿elfe for the truth, when God pitched that price. And though it be Å¿ometimes at lower prices, yet that is a price that muÅ¿t be pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wee muÅ¿t be willing to give it,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:150587:196"/> if God call for it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31, 32. <hi>Yee Å¿hall be my DiÅ¿ciples, and yee Å¿hall know the truth.</hi> The knowledge then of the Truth, and being a DiÅ¿ciple are both of a price. Looke what it will coÅ¿t to be a DiÅ¿ciple, that it may coÅ¿t to get the truth.

I confeÅ¿Å¿e this is a Å¿harp price when God calls for it, and yet this price muÅ¿t then be given. Wee Å¿aw before that it is a commodity royally worth what ever God askes for it. This men count too high a price and Å¿o Å¿tart at it that they let the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine goe. They deale juÅ¿t in this caÅ¿e as <hi>Boaz</hi> his kinÅ¿man did in the buying of <hi>Naomies</hi> land, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Hee Å¿aid, I will redeeme or buy it:</hi> I, but <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 5. <hi>Boaz</hi> tells him of a condition that goes with the bargaine, <hi>What day thou buyeÅ¿t

Oh Å¿ay men, wee will buy it with all our hearts.

Hee that buyes a commodity, and comes with falÅ¿e coyne, hee doth not buy, but hee cheats: Hee is a cheater, not a chapman.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:150587:198"/> weight. If a man pay gold the mettall is currant, but if gold want weight, and be light, it will not paÅ¿Å¿e, and proves not currant for want of weight. If money be weight, yet if it be not good mettall, be falÅ¿e and counterfeit coyne, be braÅ¿Å¿e and copper, be gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or Å¿ilver'd braÅ¿Å¿e, that's not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: But when money is good for the materiall, is true Å¿ilver and true gold, and when it is good for the weight, then it is currant money. And Å¿uch money muÅ¿t they buy withall that will buy truth, and will trade with God for this commodity. Now this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant money is not onely to <hi>uÅ¿e the meanes,</hi> and to uÅ¿e them <hi>with induÅ¿try,</hi> but to uÅ¿e the meanes with <hi>induÅ¿try in Å¿incerity, out of</hi> a love and <hi>with a love</hi> of the Truth for it Å¿elfe. To uÅ¿e meanes and uÅ¿e them induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the truth, and not Å¿incerely out of a love of the truth, but for other ends, this is to offer copper, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit coyne, and God will not part with his commodity for Å¿uch coyne: Hee will not part with it but for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:150587:198"/> money: Hee will buy, and weigh every peece of our money, and when hee findes that men goe about to cheat him with falÅ¿e and counterfeit coyne, they Å¿hall none of his commodity. <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell thee to buy of me gold tryed in the fire.</hi> We muÅ¿t not thinke to buy gold with copper and braÅ¿Å¿e, but men muÅ¿t give good gold for this gold if ever they meane to have it. As hee <hi>offers</hi> gold tryed in the fire, Å¿o hee <hi>requires</hi> gold tryed in the fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>To Å¿tir up your Å¿incere mindes, that yee may bee mindefull of the words, &amp;c.</hi> And Å¿o men muÅ¿t come with Å¿incere mindes, if they would underÅ¿tand the words of the Prophets, and come to the knowledge of the truth in the Scriptures. Yea, when men will be buying with falÅ¿e coyne, they Å¿hal not only not buy what they would have, but they Å¿hall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and loÅ¿e what they Å¿eemed to have bought, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12. that which hee had Å¿eemed to have bought. They Å¿hall miÅ¿Å¿e of what they would buy, and they Å¿hall loÅ¿e what they have bought. And therefore <hi>David</hi> deÅ¿ires
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:150587:199"/> of God that hee may have the Truth, and the knowledge of it, becauÅ¿e hee dealt honeÅ¿tly with him, paid him current money, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.10. <hi>With my whole heart,</hi> that is, with a Å¿ingle and Å¿incere heart, <hi>have I Å¿ought thee,</hi> and thy truth, <hi>Oh let mee not wander from thy Commandements,</hi> let mee not miÅ¿Å¿e of the knowledge of thy Truth: Lord here is current money, let mee have the commodity. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered money for the gift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly GhoÅ¿t. Hee is denyed it, becauÅ¿e he thought to buy it that way: But if hee had offered to buy it another way; hee Å¿hould have beene alÅ¿o denyed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Thine heart is not right in the Å¿ight of God.</hi> Hee would have had that gift onely to have made an advantage of it, to have <hi>brought him in money,</hi> and therefore <hi>he offered money,</hi> therefore he deÅ¿ired not that gift Å¿incerely for the gifts Å¿ake. So when mens hearts are not right in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, they uÅ¿e meanes, and take paines to get knowledge of the Truth, not for the love of the Truth, but for other by,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:150587:199"/> and baÅ¿e ends, that they may have credit or advantage by it, this is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer falÅ¿e coyne, and their heart is not right, and Gods Truth and Grace Å¿hall never be bought for falÅ¿e coyne: But when the meanes are uÅ¿ed, uÅ¿ed indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿triouÅ¿ly and Å¿incerely, it is much to Å¿ee how freely God will part with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to Å¿uch, Å¿incerity will bring in great encreaÅ¿es of the knowledge of the Truth, and all other graces. <hi>The Å¿ecret of the Lord is with them that feare him, PÅ¿al.</hi> 25. When God Å¿ees mens hearts Å¿incere in the Å¿eeking of the Truth, hee will liberally communicate his gifts and graces to them; nothing helpes a man to buy Å¿uch great penny worths as Å¿incerity doth: For as men, Å¿o God loves to trade and deale with Å¿uch as will deale honeÅ¿tly, and will be currant pay-maÅ¿ters, will pay currant coyne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth</hi> thing in which this buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿tands, is, <hi>To buy in time,</hi> and whilÅ¿t <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the commodity is to be had. A man that meanes to buy a commodity will take his time, and his Å¿eaÅ¿on, will be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:150587:200"/> Å¿ure to be at the Market, and the faire, when the commodity is to be had. A man that meanes to buy, will not miÅ¿Å¿e nor loÅ¿e the Market day, nor the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket time. Hee will make haÅ¿te to the market, and be Å¿ure to take his time, becauÅ¿e if hee come too late the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity will be gone, and then he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy that hee wants. If a man come the day after the fayre, and the morrow after the market, hee may goe home as wiÅ¿e as hee came. Nay, if a man come to the market to buy, and walke up and downe, talke with this body, and that: If hee goe and Å¿it and talke away the market time in the Ale-houÅ¿e, bibbing, and twatling with this and that idle companion, before hee mindes it the market is over, and done, and hee cannot buy becauÅ¿e the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is all gone. Hee cannot buy becauÅ¿e through negligence and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e hee loÅ¿t this market time. But hee that meanes to buy will doe that firÅ¿t, will waite upon his market time, will doe that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e firÅ¿t, and then if hee have any Å¿pare time, hee can Å¿pend it
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:150587:200"/> upon other leÅ¿Å¿e neceÅ¿Å¿ary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So here, hee that will buy truth, muÅ¿t watch and take his market time, muÅ¿t be buying truth whileÅ¿t truth may be bought. There is a <hi>buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time,</hi> and a trading time for truth, <hi>EccleÅ¿.</hi> 3.1. <hi>To every thing there is a Å¿eaÅ¿on, and a time to every purpoÅ¿e under Heaven.</hi> And there is a time, and a Å¿eaÅ¿on, in which God offers Truth to bee Å¿old, in which men may buy it, and obtaine it, <hi>Luc.</hi> 19.42. <hi>If thou hadÅ¿t knowne, at leaÅ¿t in this thy day, &amp;c. verÅ¿.</hi> 44. <hi>Thou knoweÅ¿t not the day of thy viÅ¿itation. This thy day,</hi> that is, this market day, in which truth and grace might have beene bought. <hi>The time of thy viÅ¿itation,</hi> that is, the market time of Grace. There is then a <hi>day,</hi> and a <hi>time,</hi> a market day, and a market time, a day and time in which Grace and Truth are to be bought. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Wee then as workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, beÅ¿eech you that yee receive not the grace of God in vaine. For hee Å¿aith, I have heard thee in a time accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in the day of Å¿alvation have I
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:150587:201"/> Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured thee: behold now the accepted time, behold now the day of Å¿alvation.</hi> Now then they that will buy the truth muÅ¿t be buying whileÅ¿t it is market time, muÅ¿t be trading for Truth and Grace whileÅ¿t they may be had, muÅ¿t ply their market whileÅ¿t the market laÅ¿ts. <hi>To day if yee will heare his voyce. Luc.</hi> 12.56. <hi>Yee can diÅ¿cerne the face of the skie, how is it that yee doe not diÅ¿cerne this time?</hi> This buying time, this Å¿elling time, this market time. It muÅ¿t be a man care that will buy, to diÅ¿cern the buying time, and to lay hold upon that time, and to follow his market cloÅ¿e whileÅ¿t it laÅ¿ts. If men will buy the truth, let them not neglect buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whileÅ¿t God offers to Å¿ell, doe not trifle away the market time of Grace, in following the world, and thy luÅ¿ts: FirÅ¿t make thy market, and when thy market is made, and thou haÅ¿t bought this commodity, that Å¿pare time thou haÅ¿t beÅ¿tow that upon Å¿ecular buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of leÅ¿Å¿e moment. A man that will buy the truth, when hee Å¿ees it is market time, muÅ¿t doe as hee Å¿peakes, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:150587:201"/> 16, 17. <hi>And all the Å¿ilver and gold, &amp;c. That thou mayeÅ¿t buy Å¿peedily with this money, bullockes, rammes, &amp;c.</hi> So when wee Å¿ee it to be market time, and the good penny worths of the GoÅ¿pel are Å¿tirring, then all the time, all the paines, all the labour you can finde in all your courÅ¿e, offer it willingly as a price, that you may buy Å¿peedily with your paines and diligence in the uÅ¿e of the meanes, knowledge of the truth, grace, and godlineÅ¿Å¿e. When ChriÅ¿t bid <hi>Judas, That which thou doeÅ¿t, doe quickly,</hi> the DiÅ¿ciples thought hee had meant, <hi>That thoÅ¿e things were neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be bought, hee Å¿hould buy quickly, Joh.</hi> 13.29. Surely Å¿o it muÅ¿t be in this caÅ¿e with all that will buy the Truth. That which yee doe, doe quickly: that which yee buy, buy quickly. So long as the GoÅ¿pel is preacht to us, Å¿o long it is market day, buying time: Therefore if yee will buy the Truth, now, now is the time, put it not off, I will buy to morrow, or next weeke, or next yeere, or at my lives end, but <hi>buy Å¿peedily,</hi> and <hi>buy preÅ¿ently:</hi> If yee
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:150587:202"/> loÅ¿e the market day, and market time, yee Å¿hall not then buy though yee would. The market may be done to morrow, the market may be paÅ¿t in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother yeere, and it will be too late to buy when the market is done. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9, 10. &amp;c. The fooliÅ¿h Virgins had their oyle to buy when they Å¿hould have had greateÅ¿t uÅ¿e of it. It was no time to goe to buy oyle when the Bridegroome was come, it was too late then, whileÅ¿t they goe to buy then, and furniÅ¿h themÅ¿elves, then the Bridegroome comes, and they are Å¿hut out of doores. Had they bought their oyle when the time of buying was, then they had entred. PreÅ¿Å¿e men to get grace, the knowledge of the truth, to be trading now whileÅ¿t the market time of the GoÅ¿pel, and their life laÅ¿ts; and their anÅ¿wer is, all in good time, hereafter may Å¿erve, at the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t at their death. I, but then it is no buying time. Alas, it is an ill time to be catechiÅ¿ed in, and to be learning the knowledge of the Truth when a man is upon his death bed. That's the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:150587:202"/> time to <hi>Å¿pend oyle,</hi> not to <hi>buy oyle.</hi> It is then <hi>dying</hi> time, not <hi>buying</hi> time, it is ill <hi>buying</hi> when a man is <hi>dying.</hi> If a man be to buy then, the doore of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be Å¿hut upon him before hee can returne from the Å¿hops. In vaine Å¿hall men Å¿eeke the truth, and grace, and to be taught when the day of grace is paÅ¿t, that would not take and buy it whileÅ¿t the market of the preaching of the GoÅ¿pel was on foot. See <hi>Joh</hi> 8.21. When the market is done, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then <hi>yee Å¿hall Å¿eeke</hi> to buy, and all the world if yee had it, yee would give to buy the Truth, and ye Å¿hall not buy <hi>but yee Å¿hall dye, and dye in your Å¿innes.</hi> It is not in the markets of the GoÅ¿pel as it is with other markets. Wee Å¿ee many will put off buying in other markets, till toward the end of the market, till men have Å¿ome commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lye upon their hands, and there be but few left to buy, and then they make account at the latter end of the market to buy at lower prices, to get better penny-worths: And Å¿o it oft proves. But it will not prove Å¿o here,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:150587:203"/> the beÅ¿t penny-worths here are to be had at the beginning of the market. At the end of the market it is a great venture if any thing will be to bee bought at all, or if it be to be bought, it cannot be had but at farre dearer prices then it might before. If thou doe get any thing it will coÅ¿t thee dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and trebble the price it might have beene had for in the prime of the market. If thou get any grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at thy death, that haÅ¿t neglected it in thy life time, and in the time of grace, it muÅ¿t be had with farre more Å¿truggling, Å¿orrowing, weeping, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, repenting, then it might have beene had for before. God is ever deerer, and his prices higher at the latter end of the market, then at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                  <p>When God offers this commodity to buy, they Å¿huffle it off, <hi>they have farmes to buy, yoakes of Oxen to buy, Luc.</hi> 14. they have Å¿o many things to buy, that they will not buy the Truth, <hi>I pray thee have mee excuÅ¿ed,</hi> I muÅ¿t lay out my time and paines for other things, I have not wherewith to buy this Truth.

                  <p>Some it may be could be content to buy it, Å¿o it might be at their owne price, if now and then a Sermon, a Chapter, reading a good Booke in a good fit, would helpe them to it, they would not greatly Å¿ticke at it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> It is a commodity that is like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to grow deere, it is a commodity that may riÅ¿e, and may be that it will bee very hard to be had. See how the world went in <hi>Elies</hi> time, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>And the Word of the Lord was precious in thoÅ¿e dayes there was no open viÅ¿ion.</hi> The Truth roÅ¿e to an high price, no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prophecying. Wee have no char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the perpetuity of the Truthes abiding with us. What know wee but it may grow as precious, to as deere and high prices as it did in <hi>Elies</hi> dayes? There is a time <hi>when running to and fro will increaÅ¿e knowledge,</hi> and helpe to buy the truth, paines are to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. And there is a time <hi>when running to and fro will doe no good,</hi> when for no price nor paines Truth will be had, <hi>Am.</hi> 8.12. And who knowes but hee may Å¿ee Å¿uch dayes? And is it not better to runne to and fro, to take paines when good will be done upon it, then to runne to and fro, when all the paines in the world will
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:150587:206"/> not helpe us to this bargaine? Wee Å¿ee how deere, extraordinary deere one kinde of graine is now with us. Had a man foreÅ¿eene it a yeere before, what a deale might hee have Å¿aved, and gained by buying good Å¿tore of that graine then! When <hi>JoÅ¿eph</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aw the Å¿even yeeres famine in Egypt, it was his wiÅ¿edome and providence to buy all the Corne that ever hee could lay his hands on, and what a world of advantage did it bring in to the King of Egypt! If hee had Å¿tayed buying till the famine came, hee could have had Corne for no money, none was to be had, and Egypt had Å¿tarved for it. So wiÅ¿ely he did to buy Corne whileÅ¿t Corne was plentifull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Buying the truth will keep the Truth and the GoÅ¿pel amongÅ¿t us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but if wee neglect and Å¿light the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it will be the loÅ¿Å¿e of the GoÅ¿pel, and all the good wee have with it. Wee Å¿ee a man that comes to market Å¿o long as men buy up his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and hee hath Å¿tore of cuÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, he keepes the market conÅ¿tantly,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:150587:207"/> and will not leave comming to the market: But if once his takings faile, and men ceaÅ¿e to buy, hee may come a while Å¿till to try if his markets will mend, but if hee Å¿ees they mend not, and men buy not, hee goes quite away and carries his commodities to Å¿ome other place, where hee may finde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trading. JuÅ¿t Å¿o here: Buying will keepe God and the GoÅ¿pel with us, keepe the market going, and the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel will never goe; but once Å¿light Gods Truth, and regard not the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his commodity, God will packe up and be gone, and try a new place for trading. <hi>Hee caÅ¿t thoÅ¿e out of the Temple that bought and Å¿old, Luc.</hi> 19. hee caÅ¿t them out for trading in the Temple, but here hee will caÅ¿t men out of the Temple, will unchurch them, will take away Church and GoÅ¿pel, becauÅ¿e men doe not buy in the Temple. If ever yee loÅ¿e the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Truth, bee aÅ¿Å¿ured that yee loÅ¿e it becauÅ¿e yee make no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of buying the truth. Yee Å¿ee many places that were great market
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:150587:207"/> Townes, that now their market is downe and quite decayed. Why Å¿o? becauÅ¿e men come not in to Å¿ell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. And why came they not in to Å¿ell? BecauÅ¿e men came not in to buy. So here: If wee will not buy the Truth, God will take his Truth away, our markets Å¿hall downe, and God will carry his Truth to Turkes, Indians, Jewes, and there God will have great and goodly markets. God will not Å¿tay long where once markets grow dead.</p>

In Å¿elling there is a parting with that, wherein we have a propriety, and wherein wee have a poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion. In Å¿elling there is an alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our right, propriety, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the commodity Å¿old, Å¿o upon the Å¿ale of my commodity, I part with it, it is no more mine, I have no more to doe with it, my commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and I are wholly parted. And
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:150587:208"/> thus hee prohibits the Å¿elling of the truth. Doe not Å¿ell it when once thou haÅ¿t it, part not with Truth, Grace, Religion upon any tearmes whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

They that Å¿ell the truth, Å¿el God, Å¿ell ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿o Å¿ell their Å¿ouls. They Å¿ell Heaven, and buy Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> How may a man keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe from Å¿elling the truth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w. FirÅ¿t,</hi> get the love of the truth into thine heart. That man that loves the truth wil never Å¿ell the truth, and the truth is never Å¿old but it is Å¿old for Å¿omething that is loved better than the truth. A man that Å¿ells it for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and gaine, loves gaine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment better then the truth, that Å¿ells it for life or liberty, loves theÅ¿e better then truth. Now let a man learne to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:150587:218"/> love the truth better than all worldly things, and hee will never Å¿ell it for them, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119.127. <hi>I love thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements above gold, yea above fine gold.</hi> Therefore to be Å¿ure hee would rather Å¿ell gold for truth, then truth for gold. Therefore they Å¿old the truth, and <hi>beleeved lyes,</hi> 2 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they received not the truth in love.</hi> A man that is in love with his houÅ¿e, with his land, no price will tempt him to Å¿ell it. If a man have but an horÅ¿e that hee loves, though hee be offered more then hee can be worth, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e hee loves him, hee will not part with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Say unto wiÅ¿dome, Thou art my Å¿iÅ¿ter, and call underÅ¿tanding thy kinÅ¿woman.</hi> A man will not Å¿ell his Å¿iÅ¿ter becauÅ¿e hee loves her. Say in in this caÅ¿e, as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Wee after our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Iewes, which were Å¿old unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; and will you even Å¿ell your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> Our fore-fathers, the Martyrs, after their ability bought the truth, and gave their lives to buy and redeem
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:150587:218"/> the truth, and we wil even Å¿ell the truth which Å¿hould be as deere to us as our brethren, as our Å¿iÅ¿ters?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> take heed, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Å¿elling Truthes of leÅ¿Å¿er mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are not Å¿o fundamentall, and Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary: Be not over eaÅ¿ie to part with them. Hee that will over eaÅ¿ily part with Å¿maller truthes, is in a dangerous preparation to Å¿ell maine and Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall Truthes. Hee that will not be brought to Å¿ell Å¿ome Å¿mall field, that lyeth far off from his houÅ¿e, hee will never be brought to Å¿ell all his whole inheritance. But when men begin once to Å¿ell here a peice, and there a piece, it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e at laÅ¿t that the whole followes after, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and manÅ¿ion houÅ¿e goes, and is Å¿old at laÅ¿t: Hee that will Å¿ell and part with little truthes, and not Å¿ticke cloÅ¿e to them, hee will if neede be Å¿it as looÅ¿e from maine fundamentall Truthes.</p>
